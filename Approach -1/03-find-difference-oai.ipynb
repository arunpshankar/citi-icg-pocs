      "Detailed Paragraph on Differences:\n",
      "SUMMARY_1 and SUMMARY_2 both provide comprehensive information on the calculation of the adjusted notional amount, maturity factor, treatment of cleared transactions, and supervisory duration for various types of derivative contracts. However, they differ significantly in their coverage of other topics. SUMMARY_1 provides detailed information on the haircuts for market price volatility, the minimum period of risk (MPOR) for a derivative contract, the hedging set amount formula, and the calculation of replacement cost and potential future exposure for derivative contracts. On the other hand, SUMMARY_2 delves into the separation of derivative contracts into separate contracts, the nature of securitization exposures, the calculation of the risk-weighted asset amount of a netting set, and definitions related to foreign exchange risk. These differences highlight the unique focus of each summary, with SUMMARY_1 emphasizing the risk management aspects of derivative contracts and SUMMARY_2 focusing more on the structural and definitional aspects of these financial instruments.\n"
