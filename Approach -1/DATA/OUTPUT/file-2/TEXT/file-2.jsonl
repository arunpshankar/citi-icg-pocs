Introduction \nThe Office of the Comptroller of the Curr ency (OCC), the Board of Governors of the \nFederal Reserve System (Board), and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) \n(collectively, the agencies) are proposing to modify the capital requirements applicable to \nbanking organizations1 with total assets of $100 billion or more and their subsidiary depository \ninstitutions (large banking organizations) and to banking organizations with significant trading activity. The revisions set forth in the proposal would strengthen the calculation of risk-based \ncapital requirements to better reflect the risks of these banking organizations\u2019 exposures. In addition, the proposed revisions would enhance the consistency of requirements across large \nbanking organizations and facilitate more effect ive supervisory and market assessments of \ncapital adequacy. \nFollowing the 2007-09 financial crisis, the agen cies adopted an initial set of reforms to \nimprove the effectiveness of and address weaknesses in the regulatory capital framework. For \nexample, in 2013, the agencies adopted a final rule that increased the quantity and quality of \nregulatory capital banking organizations must maintain.\n2 These changes were broadly consistent \n1 The term \u201cbanking organizations\u201d includes nati onal banks, state member banks, state \nnonmember banks, federal savings associations, state savings associations, top-tier bank holding \ncompanies domiciled in the United States not subject to the Board\u2019s Small Bank Holding \nCompany and Savings and Loan Holding Company Policy Statement (12 CFR part 225, appendix C), U.S. intermediate holding companies of foreign banking organizations, and top-tier savings and loan holding compan ies domiciled in the United St ates, except for certain savings \nand loan holding companies that are substantia lly engaged in insurance underwriting or \ncommercial activities and savings and loan holding companies that are subject to the Small Bank \nHolding Company and Savings and Loan Holding Company Policy Statement. \n2 The Board and the OCC issued a joint final rule on October 11, 2013 (78 FR 62018) and the \nFDIC issued a substantially identical interim final rule on September 10, 2013 (78 FR 55340). In \nApril 2014, the FDIC adopted the interim final rule as a final rule with no substantive changes. \n79 FR 20754 (April 14, 2014). \nPage 10 of 1089 "}

The agencies \nassessed the likely effect of the proposal on economic activity and resilience, and expect that the \nbenefits of strengthening capital requirements for large banking organizations outweigh the costs.\n9 \nHistorical experience has demonstrated the im pact individual banking organizations can \nhave on the stability of the U.S. banking system, in particular banking organizations that would \nhave been subject to the proposal.

The \nproposal would also adopt new standardized approaches for market risk and credit valuation \nadjustment (CVA) risk that better reflect the risks of banking organizations\u2019 exposures. \nThis new framework for calculating risk-weigh ted assets (the expanded risk-based \napproach) would apply to banking organizations w ith total assets of $100 billion or more and \ntheir subsidiary depository institutions. The revised requirements for market risk would also apply to other banking organizations with $5 billion or more in trading assets plus trading liabilities or for which trading assets plus trad ing liabilities exceed 10 percent of total assets. \nThe expanded risk-based approach would be m ore risk-sensitive than the current U.S. \nstandardized approach by incorporating more cred it-risk drivers (for example, borrower and loan \ncharacteristics) and explicitly differentiati ng between more types of risk (for example, \noperational risk, credit valuation adjustment risk). In this manner, the expanded risk-based approach would better account for key risks faced by large banking organizations. The proposed changes would also enhance the alignment of capital requirements to the risks of banking organizations\u2019 exposures and increase incentives for prudent risk management. \nTo ensure that large banking organizations  would not have lower capital requirements \nthan smaller, less complex banking organizations , the proposal would maintain the capital rule\u2019s \ndual-requirement structure.

Banking organizations subject \nto Category III or IV capital standards would be subject to the same treatment of accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI), capital de ductions, and rules for minority interest as \nbanking organizations subject to Category I or II capital standards.

Under this framework, Category I capital \nstandards apply to U.S. global systemically  important bank holding companies and their \ndepository institution subsidiaries. Category II capital standards apply to banking organizations \nwith at least $700 billion in total consolidated  assets or at least $75 billion in cross-jurisdictional \nactivity and their depository institution subsidiar ies. Category III capital standards apply to \nbanking organizations with total consolidated a ssets of at least $250 billion or at least $75 billion \nin weighted short-term wholesale funding, nonbank assets, or off-balance sheet exposure and \ntheir depository institution subsidiaries.

Regulatory capital deductions \nThe agencies have long limited the amount of intangible and higher-risk assets, such as \nmortgage servicing assets (MSAs) and certain  temporary difference DTAs, included in \nregulatory capital and required deduction of the amounts above the limits.

Additionall y, the proposal would differentiate the criteria \nfor determining whether an exposure is a defa ulted exposure between exposures that are retail \nexposures and those that are not. \nRetail exposures are originated to individua ls or small- and medium-sized businesses.  \nEvaluating whether a retail borrower has other expos ures that are in default as defined by the \nproposal may be difficult to operationalize for banking organizations given many unique obligors. For other types of exposures that ar e not retail exposures, evaluating default at the \nobligor level is appropriate because those obligors are more likely to have additional credit obligations that are large and held by multiple  banking organizations. Default on one of those \ncredit obligations would be indicative of incr eased riskiness of the exposure held by a banking \norganization, and hence a banking organization shoul d account for this in evaluating the risk \nprofile of the borrower. \nUnder the proposal, for a retail exposure, a cr edit obligation would be considered a \ndefaulted exposure if any of the following has occ urred: (1) the exposure is 90 days past due or \nin nonaccrual status; (2) the banking organization has taken a partial charge-off, write-down of \nPage 45 of 1089 "}

Exposures that are \ndependent on the cash flows generated by real es tate to repay the loan can be affected by local \nmarket conditions and present elevated credit ri sk relative to exposures that are serviceable by \nthe income, cash, or other assets of the borrower. For example, an increase in the supply of \ncompetitive rental property can lower demand a nd suppress cash flows needed to support \nrepayment of the loan.  \nIf the underwriting process at origination of th e real estate exposure considers any cash \nflows generated by the real estate securing the loan, such as from lease or rental payments or from the sale of the real estate as a source of repayment, then the exposure would meet the proposal\u2019s definition of dependent on the cash flows generated by the real estate. Evaluating whether repayment of the exposure is dependent on cash flows generated from the real estate is a \nconservative and straightforward approach for differentiating the credit risk of real estate \nexposures. Given their increased credit risk, the proposal would assign relatively higher risk \nweights to exposures that are dependent on a ny proceeds or income generated from the real \nestate itself to service the debt. \nUnder the proposal, additional loan characteristics can affect whether an exposure would \nbe considered dependent on cash flows from the real estate.

The proposal would introduce a definition \nof defaulted real estate exposure that would provide new criteria for determining whether a \nresidential mortgage exposure or a non-residential mortgage exposure is in default. These new \ncriteria are indicative of a credit-related default for such exposures. For residential mortgage exposures, the definition of defaulted real  estate exposure would require the banking \norganization to evaluate default at the exposure lev el. For other real estate exposures that are not \nresidential mortgage exposures, the definition of defaulted real estate exposure would require the \nbanking organization to evaluate default at the obligor level, consistent with the approach \ndescribe above for non-retail defaulted exposures. \nSince residential mortgage exposures are primarily originated to individuals for the \npurchase or refinancing of their primary residen ce, most obligors of residential real estate \nexposures do not have additional real estate e xposures. Therefore, determining default at the \nexposure level would account for the material de fault risk of most residential mortgage \nPage 75 of 1089 "}

Default by an obligor on other credit obligations, which a banking organization should  account for when evaluating the risk profile of \nthe borrower, would indicate increased credit risk of the exposure held by a banking organization. \nA defaulted real estate exposure that is a re sidential mortgage exposure would include an \nexposure (1) that is 90 days or more past due or in nonaccrual status; (2) where the banking \norganization has taken a partial charge-off, write-down of principal, or negative fair value \nadjustment on the exposure for credit-related reasons, until the banking organization has \nreasonable assurance of repayment and performan ce for all contractual principal and interest \npayments on the exposure; or (3) where the banking organization agreed to a distressed restructuring that includes the following cr edit-related reasons: forgiveness or postponement of \nprincipal, interest, or fees; term extension; or an  interest rate reduction.

Retail exposures \nRelative to the current standardized approach, an d as described in more detail below, the \nproposal would increase the credit risk-sensitivity of the capital requirements applicable to retail \nexposures by assigning risk weights that would vary depending on product type and the degree \nof portfolio diversification. The proposal would introduce a new definition of retail exposure, which would include an exposure to a natural person or persons, or an exposure to a small or \nmedium-sized entity (SME)\n92 that meets the proposed definition of  a regulatory retail exposure \ndescribed below. Including an exposure to an SME in the definition of a retail exposure provides a benefit for small companies, such as smaller  limited liability companies, which may have \ncharacteristics more similar to those of a natural person than of a larger corporation. The \nproposed definition of a retail e xposure would be narrower in scope than the current capital \nrule\u2019s existing definition of a retail exposure under subpart E, which includes a broader range of \nexposures, including real estate-related exposures. Because the proposal would include separate \nrisk-weight treatments for real estate exposures that account for the underlying collateral, the \nproposed definition of a retail e xposure would only apply to a retail exposure that would not \notherwise be a real estate exposure.\n93 \n92 An SME would mean an entity in which the reported annual revenues or sales for the \nconsolidated group of which the entity is a part are less than or equal to $50 million for the most \nrecent fiscal year. This scope is generally consistent with the definition of an SME under the \nBasel III reforms and also corresponds with the maximum receipts-based size standard for small \nbusinesses set by the Small Business Administra tion, which varies by industry and does not \nexceed $47 million per year. See 13 CFR part 121. \n93 For an exposure that qualifies as a real estate exposure and also meets conditions (1) and (2) of \nthe definition of a retail exposure, the proposal w ould require a banking organization to treat the \nexposure as a real estate exposure and calculate risk-based requirements for the exposure as \ndescribed in section III.C.2.e of this Supplementary Information. \nPage 81 of 1089 "}

The proposed definition s of a regulatory retail exposure and a transactor \nexposure outlined below include key criteria for broadly categorizing the relative credit risk of \nretail exposures. \nTo qualify as a regulatory retail exposure, the proposal would require the exposure to be \nin the form of any of the following credit products : a revolving credit or line of credit (such as a \ncredit card, charge card, or overdraft) or a term loan  or lease (such as an installment loan, auto \nloan or lease, or student or educational loan) (collectively, eligible products). In addition, under \nthe proposal, the amount of retail exposures that a banking organization could treat as regulatory retail exposures would be limited on an aggr egate and granular basis.

Therefore, any retail exposure that would not \nqualify as a regulatory retail or a transactor exposure warrants a risk weight of 110 percent. \nThe following example describes how a banking organization would identify the amount \nof retail exposures that could be treated as regulatory retail exposures. First, a banking organization would identify the amount of credit exposures that meet the eligible products criterion within the definition of a regulato ry retail exposure.

For example, a project finance exposure could take the form of financing the construction of a new inst allation, or a refinancing of an existing \ninstallation, with or without improvements. The primary determinant of credit risk for a project finance exposure is the variability of the cash flows expected to be generated by the project being financed rather than the general creditworthiness  of the obligor or the market value or sale of the \nproject or the real estate on which the project sits.\n97 A project finance exposure also would be \nrequired to meet the following criteria: (1) the exposure would need to be to a borrowing entity that was created specifically to finance the project, operate the physical assets of the project, or \ndo both, and (2) the borrowing entity would need to have an immaterial amount of assets, activities, or sources of income apart from reve nues from the activities of the project being \nfinanced.

For the \ninterest rate asset class, a banking organization must set the value of \u03bb for a given currency equal \nto the greater of (i) the negative of the lowest value of the strike prices and the current values of the interest rate underlying all interest rate options in a given currency that the banking \norganization has with all counterparties plus 0.1 percent; and (ii) zero. \nPage 102 of 1089 "}

Such option contracts are commonly traded in the OTC \nderivatives market, including option contracts on the spread between two commodity prices and on the difference in performance across two equity indices. Under the current capital rule, banking organizations cannot calculate the supervi sory delta adjustment for any option contract \nother than an interest rate derivative contract if the strike price or the current value of the \nunderlying instrument or risk factor is negative because the SA-CCR final rule only allows a non-zero value for \u03bb for interest rate derivative contracts.

The SEC-SA is based on assumptions and the risk weight floor ensures \na minimum level of capital is held to accoun t for modelling risks and correlation risks.138 The \nproposal would apply a risk weight floor of 15 perc ent for securitization exposures that are not \nresecuritization exposures. The 15 percent risk weight floor is most relevant for more senior \nsecuritization exposures. While junior tranches ca n absorb a significant amount of credit risk, \nsenior tranches are still exposed to some am ount of credit risk on the underlying exposures. \nTherefore, a minimum prudential capital requir ement continues to be appropriate in the \nsecuritization context. \n137 See sections III.C.2 and III.D.2.d of this Supplementary Information for a more detailed \ndiscussion of the reduced risk weights applicable to certain underlying assets and the risk-weight \nfloor, respectively. \n138 Default correlation is the likelihood that two or more exposures will default at the same time. \nPage 145 of 1089 "}

These idiosyncratic risks associated with NPL securitizations merit a higher minimum risk weight. \n3. Exceptions to the SEC-SA risk-based capital treatment for securitization \nexposures \nSecuritization exposures sometimes contain unique features that, if not accounted for, \ncould produce inconsistent outcomes under the SEC-SA  or in some cases make the calculation of \nthe risk weight inoperable. Thus, notwithstanding the general application of SEC-SA, the proposal would include additional approaches to account for certain types of securitization \n139 In a typical securitization exposure that is not a resecuritization, each underlying exposure is \nsubject to idiosyncratic default risks (for example, the employment status of each obligor) which \nmay exhibit lower relative default correlation. In a resecuritization exposure, the underlying exposures, which are typically tranches of secu ritizations, usually have credit enhancement from \nmore junior tranches that protects against many idiosyncratic risks. Systematic risks are more \nlikely to generate defaults in the underlying exposures of resecuritizations than idiosyncratic \nrisks, but systematic risks are also much more correlated; therefore, resecuritizations typically have higher default correlations than other types of securitizations. \nPage 146 of 1089 "}

The one exception is interest-earning a ssets, which would be calculated as the average \nof the quarterly values of interest-earning assets for the previous 12 quarters.179 \n178 Recent research connecting operational risk to higher business volume includes Frame, \nMcLemore, and Mihov (2020), Haste Makes Waste: Banking Organization Growth and \nOperational Risk, Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, https://www.dallasfed.org/research/papers/2020/wp2023 ; Curti, Frame, and Mihov (2019), Are \nthe Largest Banking Organizations Operationally  More Risky?, Journal of Money, Credit and \nBanking Vol. 54, Issue 5, 1223-1259, https://doi.org/10.1111/jmcb.12933; and Abdymomunov and Curti (2020), Quantifying and Stress Testing Operational Risk with Peer Banks\u2019 Data, \nJournal of Financial Services Research Vol. 57, 287-313, https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10693-019-00320-w. \n179 Unlike the other inputs used to calculate the business indicator, interest-earning assets are \nbalance-sheet items, rather than income stateme nt items, and thus their use in the business \nindicator does not represent a flow over a one-yea r period, but rather a po int-in-time value.

Market risk \n1. Background \na. Description of market risk Market risk for a banking organization results from exposure to price movements caused \nby changes in market conditions, market events, and issuer events that affect asset prices. Losses \nresulting from ma rket risk can affect a banking organization\u2019s capital strength, liquidity, and \nprofitability. To help ensure that a banking or ganization maintains a sufficient amount of capital \nto withstand adverse market risks and consistent with amendments to the Basel Capital Accord, the agencies adopted risk-based capital standards for market risk in 1996 (1996 rule).\n217 \nAlthough adoption of the 1996 rule was a constructi ve step in capturing market risk, the 1996 \nrule did not sufficiently capture the risks associated with financial instruments that became \nprevalent in the years following its adoption. This became evident during the 2007 \u20132009 \nfinancial crisis, when the 1996 rule did not fully capture banking organizations\u2019 increased \nexposures to traded credit and other structured products, such as collateralized debt obligations \n(CDO), credit default swaps (CDS), mortgage-related securitizations, and exposures to other less liquid products.  \n217 61 FR 47358 (September 6, 1996). The agencies\u2019 market risk capital rules were located at 12 \nCFR part 3, Appendix B (OCC), 12 CFR part 208, Appendix E and 12 CFR part 225, Appendix \nE (Board), and 12 CFR part 325, Appendix C (FDIC). \nPage 219 of 1089 "}

The proposal would also improve the transparency of market risk capital re quirements through enhanced disclosures. \n2. Scope and application of the proposed rule \na. Scope of the proposed rule \nCurrently, any banking organization with aggregate trading assets and trading liabilities \nthat, as of the most recent calendar quarter, equal to $1 billion or more, or 10 percent or more of \nthe banking organization\u2019s total consolidated assets , is required to calculate market risk capital \nrequirements under subpart F of the current capital rule. \nThe proposal would revise the criteria for determining whether a banking organization is \nsubject to subpart F of the capital rule. Under the proposal, large banking organizations, as well \nas those with significant trading activity, w ould be required to calculate market risk capital \nrequirements under subpart F of the capital rule. Specifically, a ba nking organization with \nsignificant trading activity would be any banking organization with average aggregate trading assets and trading liabilities, excluding cust omer and proprietary broker-dealer reserve bank \naccounts,\n236 over the previous four calendar quarters equal to $5 billion or more, or equal to 10 \npercent or more of total consolidated assets at quarter end as reported on the most recent \nquarterly regulatory report. Under the proposal, any holding company subject to Category I, II, \nIII, or IV standards or any subsidiary thereof, if the subsidiary engaged in any trading activity over any of the four most recent quarters, would be subject to subpart F of the capital rule. \n236 The proposal would define customer and proprietary broker-dealer reserve bank accounts as \nsegregated accounts established by a subsidiary of a banking organization that fulfill the \nrequirements of 17 CFR 240.15c3-3 (SEC Rule 15c3-3) or 17 CFR 1.20 (CFTC Regulation \n1.20). \nPage 229 of 1089 "}

As the agencie s noted in the preamble to the final regulatory tiering rule, \ndue to their operational scale or global presen ce, banking organizations subject to Category I or \nII capital standards pose heightened risks to U.S. financial stability which would benefit from \nmore stringent capital requirements bei ng applied to such banking organizations.237 As banking \norganizations subject to Category I or II capital sta ndards are generally subject to rules based on \nthe standards published by the Basel Commit tee, the proposed scope would help promote \ncompetitive equity among U.S. banking organizations and their foreign peers and competitors, and reduce opportunities for regulatory arbitrage across jurisdictions. In addition, given the \nincreasing size and complexity of activities of banking organizations subject to Category III and IV capital standards and the risks such banking organizations pose to U.S. financial stability, it \nwould be appropriate to require such banking organi zations to be subject to the proposed market \nrisk capital requirements, which prov ide for enhanced risk sensitivity.  \nIn addition to applying subpart F of the capital  rule to large banking organizations, the \nproposed rule would retain a trad ing activity threshold.

A banking organization whose trading assets and trading liabilities are equal to 10 per cent or more of its total assets would continue to be subject to \nsubpart F of the capital rule under the proposal. This means that a banking organization that is not subject to Category I, II, III, or IV capital sta ndards may still be subject to subpart F if it \nexceeds either of these quantitative thresholds . The proposed trading activity dollar threshold \nwould be measured using the average aggregate trad ing assets and trading liabilities of a banking \n237 See 84 FR 59230, 59249 (November 1, 2019). \nPage 230 of 1089 "}

Foreign exchange risk \nThe proposal would define the delta risk factors for foreign exchange risk as the \nexchange rate between the currency in which the market risk covered position is denominated \nand the reporting currency of the banking organization. For market risk covered positions that reference two currencies other than the reporting currency, the banking organization generally would be required to calculate the delta risk factors  for foreign exchange risk using the exchange \nrates between each of the non-reporting currencies and that of the reporting currency. For example, for a foreign exchange forward referencing EUR/JPY, the relevant risk factors for a USD-reporting banking organization to consider would be the exchange rates for USD/EUR and \nUSD/JPY. \nTo reduce operational burden and help ensure the delta capital requirements reflect \nforeign exchange risk, the proposal would also allow a banking organization to calculate delta risk factors for foreign exchange risk relative to a base currency instead of the reporting \ncurrency, if approved by the primary Federal supervisor.\n312 In this case, after designating a single \n312 A banking organization would have to demonstrat e to its primary Federal supervisor that \ncalculating foreign exchange risk relative to it s base currency provides an appropriate risk \nrepresentation of the banking organization\u2019s market risk covered positions and that the foreign \nexchange risk between the base currency and the reporting currency is addressed. In general, the \nbase currency would be the functional currency in which the banking organization generates or expends cash. For example, a multinational ba nking organization headquartered in the United \nStates that primarily transacts in and uses EUR to value its assets and liabilities for internal accounting and risk management purposes could use EUR as its base currency. As its consolidated financial statement must be re ported in USD, this multinational banking \norganization would need to translate the value of those assets and liabilities from the base \ncurrency (EUR) to the reporting currency (USD).

The default risk buckets for non-securitization positions in the Basel III reforms are defined based on the applicable credit ratings of the reference entity.

For this analysis, \nthe agencies used the Mergent Fixed Income Securities database to identify notional issuance \namounts for several lookback periods. The weighted average risk weight for each category was then slightly modified to account for rounding, to re flect internal consistency (so that a corporate \nor PSE exposure would not have a lower risk weight  than a sovereign) and to help ensure risk \nweights were stable through an entire credit cyc le. The agencies believe the amended risk weight \ntable appropriately satisfies the requirements  of the Dodd-Frank Act, while also meeting the \nintent of the Basel III reforms.

Securitization positions non-CTP \nFor securitization positions non-CTP, the proce ss to calculate the standardized default \nrisk capital requirement would be identical to that for non-securitization positions, except for the \ngross default exposure calculation, the offsetting of long and short exposures in the net default exposure calculation, and the proposed risk  buckets and corresponding risk weights. \nI. Gross default exposure \nUnder the proposal, the gross default expos ure for a securitization position non-CTP \nequals the position\u2019s fair value.

Risk buckets and corresponding risk weights \nTo promote consistency and comparability in risk-based capital requirements across \nbanking organizations, the proposal would define the risk bucket structure that a banking \norganization would be required to use to group securitization positions non-CTP.

What are the \npotential benefits and drawbacks of aligning the default risk bucketing structure with the proposed delta risk buckets for securitization positions non-CTP in the sensitivities-based method? Commenters are encouraged to provide information regarding any associated burden, complexity, and capital impact of such an alignment. \niii. Correlation trading positions \nThe process to calculate the standardized defa ult risk capital requirement for correlation \ntrading positions would be the same as that for non-securitization debt and equity positions, except for the metrics used to measure gross defa ult exposure, the offsetting of long and short \nexposures in the net default exposure calculation, the risk buckets, and the aggregation of the \nbucket level exposures across risk buckets. \nI.

The proposed \ncalculation is intended to appropriately reflect the credit subordination of such positions. \nII. Net default exposure \nSimilar to securitization positions non-CTP, to increase risk sensitivity and permit greater \noffsetting of substantially similar exposures, the proposal would permit banking organizations to \noffset gross long and short default exposures in specific cases. \nFirst, the proposal would allow a banking organization to offset the gross default \nexposure of correlation trading positions that ar e otherwise identical except for maturity, \nincluding index tranches of the same series. This means the offsetting positions would need to \nhave the same underlying index family of the same series, and the same attachment and detachment points.  \nSecond, the proposal would allow a banking organization to offset the gross default \nexposure of long and short exposures of tranches that are perfect replications of non-tranched \ncorrelation trading positions. For example, the proposal would allow a banking organization to \noffset the gross default exposure of a long position in the CDX.NA.IG.24 index with short positions that together comprise the entire inde x position (for example, three distinct tranches \nthat attach and detach at 0 - 3 percent, 3 - 10 percent, and 10 - 100 percent, respectively). \nThird, the proposal would allow a banking organization to offset the gross default \nexposure of indices and single-name constituents  in the indices through decomposition when the \nlong and the short gross default exposures are otherwise equivalent except for a residual \ncomponent. Under the proposal, a banking organization would account for the residual exposure in the calculation of the net default exposure. In such cases, the proposal would require that the \nPage 352 of 1089 "}

Such decomposition generally would be \npermissible for correlation trading positions (for example, vanilla CDOs, index tranches or \nbespoke indices), but would be prohibited for exotic  securitizations (for example, CDO squared). \nFourth, the proposal would allow a banking organization to offset the gross default \nexposure of different series (non-tranched) of the same index through decomposition when the \nlong and the short gross default exposures are otherwise equivalent except for a residual \ncomponent. Under the proposal, a banking organization would account for the residual exposure in the calculation of the net default exposure. Fo r example, assume that a banking organization \nholds a long position in a CDS index that references 125 underlying credits and a short position \nin the next series of the index that also references 125 credits. The two indices share the same \n123 reference credits, such that there are two unique credits in each index. Under the proposal, a \nbanking organization could offset the 123 names through decomposition, in which case the net \ndefault exposure would reflect only the two uni que credits for the long index position and the \ntwo unique credits for the short index position. Similarly, a banking organization could offset the \nlong exposure in 125 credits by selling short an index that contains 123 of those same credits. In \nthis case, only the two residual names would be reflected in the net default exposure. \nFifth, the proposal would allow a banking orga nization to offset different tranches of the \nsame index and series through replication and decomposition and calculate a net default exposure on the unique component  only, if the residual comp onent has the attachment and \ndetachment point nested with the original tran che or the combination of tranches.

To hedge this position, the banking organization holds a short position in a tranche on \nthe same index that attaches at 5 percent and de taches at 20 percent. In this case, the banking \norganization's net default exposure would only be for the residual portion of the tranche that \nattaches at 15 percent and detaches at 20 percent. \nIII. Risk buckets and corresponding risk weights \nFor correlation trading positions, the proposal would define risk buckets by index, each \nindex would comprise its own risk bucket.369 Under the proposal, a bespoke correlation trading \nposition would be assigned to its own unique bucket, unless it is substantially similar to an index instrument, in which case the bespoke position would be assigned to the risk bucket corresponding to the index. For a non-securitizati on position that hedges a correlation trading \nposition, a banking organization would be required  to assign such position and the correlation \ntrading position to the same bucket. \nFor consistency in the capital requiremen ts for securitizations under either subpart D or \nsubpart E of the capital rule and to recognize credit subordination,\n370 the proposed risk weights \n369 A non-exhaustive list of indices include: th e CDX North America IG, iTraxx Europe IG, \nCDX HY, iTraxx XO, LCDX (loan index), iTra xx LevX (loan index), Asia Corp, Latin America \nCorp, Other Regions Corp, Major Sovereign (G7 and Western Europe) and Other Sovereign. \n370 For example, the general credit risk frame work would apply the SSFA to calculate the risk \nweight.

To appropriately limit the benefit of risk buckets with short default exposures offsetting those with long exposures, the total standardized default risk capital requirement for \ncorrelation trading positions would be calculated as the sum of the risk-bucket level capital requirements for the net long default exposures plus half of the sum of the risk-weighted exposures for the net short default exposures. \nc. Residual risk capital requirement \nIt is not possible in a standardized approach to sufficiently specify all relevant \ndistinctions between different market risks to ca pture appropriately existing and future financial \nproducts. Accordingly, the agencies are proposing th e residual risk add-on capital requirement \n(residual risk add-on) to reflect risks that would not be fully reflected in the sensitivities-based \ncapital requirement or the standardized default ri sk capital requirement. Specifically, the residual \nrisk add-on is intended to capture exotic risks, such as weather, longevity, and natural disasters, \nas well as other residual risks, such as gap ri sk, correlation risk, and behavioral risks such as \nprepayments. \n371 12 CFR 3.43, 3.143, 3.144 (OCC); 12 CFR 217.43, 217.143, 217.144 (Board); 12 CFR \n324.43, 324.143, 324.144 (FDIC). \nPage 355 of 1089 "}

The proposed exclusions would permit a banking organization to exclude simple options, such as spread options, which have two underl ying positions, but not those for which the payoffs \ncannot be replicated by a combination of traded financial instruments.

Additionally, as most agency mortgage-backed securities and certain convertible instruments (for example, callable bonds) are eligible to be cleared, the proposal would all ow a banking organization to exclude these instruments that are \neligible to be cleared from the residual risk add-on, despite the pre-payment risk of such \ninstruments.\n373 \nThe proposal would also allow a banking organization to exclude positions, including \nthose with exotic exposures, from the resi dual risk add-on if the banking organization has \nentered into a third-party transaction that ex actly matches the market risk covered position (a \nback-to-back transaction).

Hybrid instruments \nHybrid instruments are instruments that have  characteristics in common with both debt \nand equity instruments, including traditional convertible bonds. As hybrid instruments primarily \nreact to changes in interest ra tes, issuer credit spreads, and equity prices, the proposal would \nrequire a banking organization to assign risk sensitivities for these instruments into the interest \nrate risk class, credit spread risk class for non-s ecuritization positions, and equity risk class, as \napplicable, when calculating the delta, curvature, and vega under the sensitivities-based method. \nFor the standardized default risk capital requirement, the proposal would require a banking organization to decompose a hybrid instrument in to a non-securitization position and an equity \nposition and calculate default risk capital for each position respectively. For example, a convertible bond can be decomposed into a van illa bond and an equity call option. The notional \namount to be used in the default risk capital calculation for the vanilla bond is the notional amount of the convertible bond. The notional amount to be used in the default risk capital calculation for the call option is zero (because, in the event of default, the call option will not be exercised). In this case, a default of an issuer of the convertible bond would extinguish the call \noption\u2019s value and this loss would be captured through the profit and loss component of the gross \nPage 360 of 1089 "}

Under the proposal, a banking organization would be required to apply consistently the l ook-through approach through time and consistently \nfor all positions that reference the same index. The proposed look-through approach would align \nthe treatment of such instruments with that of single-name positions and thus provide greater hedging recognition by allowing such instruments to net with single-name positions issued by \nthe same company.

For example, a banking organ ization may receive data from a third-party \nprovider on the dates and number of real prices, as described in section III.H.8.a.i.I of this Supplementary Information. While such data demonstrates the liquidity of a risk factor for purposes of the risk factor eligibility test, without the transaction prices, such real prices would not provide any value to calibrate potential  losses for a particular risk factor. \nTo help ensure the appropriateness of the da ta and other information used to calibrate the \nexpected shortfall models for IMCC, the proposal w ould establish data quality requirements for \nrisk factors to be deemed mod ellable risk factors. Under the proposal, any risk factor that passes \nthe risk factor eligibility test but subsequently fails to meet any of the following seven proposed data quality requirements would be a non-modellable risk factor. \nPage 377 of 1089 "}

Rather, the proposed revisions would clarify that the same types of positions are captured under subpart F as under subparts D and E of the capital rule, which \ncurrently use substantially similar, but separate definitions. \n423 Section 2 of the capital rule defines a secur itization exposure as an on- or off-balance sheet \ncredit exposure (including credit-enhancing repres entations and warranties) that arises from a \ntraditional or synthetic securitiz ation (including a resecuritization), or an exposure that directly \nor indirectly references a securitization exposure. The agencies\u2019 capital rule defines a traditional \nsecuritization, in part, as a transaction in which al l or a portion of the credit risk of one or more \nunderlying exposures is transferred to one or m ore third parties (other than through the use of \ncredit derivatives or guarantees), where the credit risk associated with the underlying exposures has been separated into at least two tranches reflecting different levels of seniority. The definition includes certain other conditions, such  as requiring all or substantially all of the \nunderlying exposures to be financial exposures.  See 12 CFR 3.2 s.v. securitization exposure, \ntraditional securitization (OCC); 12 CFR 217.2 s ecuritization exposure, traditional securitization \n(Board); and 12 CFR 324.2 securitization expo sure, traditional securitization (FDIC). \nPage 430 of 1089 "}

The designation of \nsecuritization exposures or resecuritization exposures and the calculation of risk-based \nrequirements for securitization exposures woul d generally depend upon the economic substance \nof the transaction rather than its legal form. Provided there is tranching of credit risk, \nsecuritization exposures could include, among other things, asset-backed securities and \nmortgage-backed securities, loans, lines of credit, liquidity facilities, financial standby letters of \ncredit, credit derivatives and guarantees, loan servicing assets, servicer cash advance facilities, \nreserve accounts, credit-enhancing representations and warranties, and credit-enhancing interest-\nonly strips (CEIOs). Securitization exposures woul d also include assets sold with retained \ntranches.424 In contrast, mortgage-backed pass-through securities (for example, those guaranteed \nby the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation or the Federal National Mortgage Association) that feature various maturities but do not invol ve tranching of credit risk do not meet the \ndefinition of a securitization exposure.

Credit valuation adjustment risk \n1. Background \nIn general, OTC derivative contracts are bilater al agreements either to make or receive \npayments or to buy or sell an underlying asset on a certain date, or dates, in the future. The value \nof an OTC derivative contract, and thus a part y\u2019s exposure to its counterparty, changes over the \n424 Securitization exposures also include a ssets sold with retained tranches. \nPage 431 of 1089 "}

In addition to the exposure to changes in the market \nvalue of OTC derivative contracts, there is also cr edit risk associated with such contracts. \nSpecifically, if a counterparty to an OTC derivative contract, or a portfolio of such contracts subject to a QMNA,\n425 defaults prior to the contract\u2019s expiration, the non -defaulting party will \nexperience a loss if the market value of the cont ract, or of the portfolio of contracts under a \nQMNA, is positive at the time of default. The risk of such a loss, known as counterparty credit risk, exists even if the current market value of the contract, or the portfolio under a QMNA, is negative because the future market value may become positive if market conditions change. Under the current capital rule, a banking organ ization determines risk-based capital requirements \nfor counterparty credit risk using the credit risk framework, with exposure amounts determined via either the SA-CCR, current exposure method (CEM), or internal models methodology, as \napplicable.\n426 \nThe valuation change of OTC derivative contracts resulting from the risk of the \ncounterparty\u2019s defaulting prior to the expiration of the contracts, known as the credit valuation \nadjustment (CVA), depends on (1) counterparty credit spreads, which reflect the creditworthiness of the counterparty perceived by the market; and (2) credit exposure generated \n425 \u201cQualifying master netting agreement\u201d (QMNA) is defined in section __.2 of the capital rule. \nIn order to recognize an agreement as a QMNA, a banking organization must meet the \noperational requirements in section __.3(d) of the capital rule. See 12 CFR 3.2, and 3.3(d) \n(OCC); 12 CFR 217.2 and 217.3(d) (Board); and 12 CFR 324.2, and 324.3(d) (FDIC). In \ngeneral, a QMNA means a netting agreement that pe rmits a banking organization to accelerate, \nterminate, close-out on a net basis and promptly liquidate or set off collateral upon default of the \ncounterparty.

An internal CVA hedge is an internal de rivative transaction that is usually executed \nbetween a CVA risk management function, such  as a CVA desk (or a functional equivalent \nthereof), and a trading desk of the banking organization. Every such internal CVA hedge has two offsetting positions: the position of the CVA risk management function (the CVA segment) and \nthe position of the trading desk (the trading desk segment).

Whether a CVA hedge is a CVA risk covered position has no impact on its qualification as an eligible CVA hedge. Specifically, a non-CVA risk covered position could be an eligible CVA hedge if it meets the proposed eligibility criteria as described below. For example, a banking organization could hedge its CVA risk using a cleared \ntransaction; in such cases, the CVA hedge woul d effectively reduce the CVA risk of the banking \norganization, though the transaction itself would not be a CVA risk covered position. The \nproposed treatment of CVA hedges intends to provide better alignment between the economic risks posed by such transactions and the risk-based capital requirement for CVA risk.

Alpha factor (\u07d9 )\nAs previously discussed, when calculating a standalone CVA counterparty-level capital \nrequirement, the proposal would require a banking organization to use the exposure amount that it uses in the counterparty credit risk framework. The exposure amount determined in the counterparty credit risk framework would be the sum of replacement cost and potential future \nexposure multiplied by a multiplication factor (the  alpha factor) to capture certain risks (for \nexample, wrong-way risk\n444 and risks resulting from non-perfect granularity).445 CVA \ncalculations are based on expected exposure,  which in SA-CCR is proxied by the sum of \nreplacement cost and potential future exposure. Accordingly, the proposal would remove the \neffect of this multiplication factor from the risk-based capital requirement for CVA risk by \ndividing the exposure at default amount used in the \u0bd6 formula by the alpha factor. \nSpecifically, the proposal would require such banking organization to use the same alpha factor \nin calculating the risk-based capital required under the BA-CVA as required in exposure amount calculations under SA-CCR by setting the alph a factor at 1.4 for derivative contracts with \ncounterparties that are not commercial end-users and at 1 for derivative contracts with commercial end-users. \n444 Wrong-way risk reflects the situation wher e exposure is positively correlated with the \ncounterparty\u2019s probability of default \u2013  that is, the exposure amount of the derivative contract \nincreases as the counterparty\u2019s probability of default increases. \n445 See 85 FR 4362 (January 24, 2020). Under SA-CCR, the alpha factor generally is set at 1.4. \nHowever, for a derivative contract with a commercial end-user counterparty, the alpha factor is \nremoved from the exposure amount formula. This is  equivalent to applying an alpha factor of 1 \nto these contracts. \nPage 457 of 1089 "}

For the \nfive exposure-related risk classes, the SA-CVA would use the same risk buckets, regulatory risk weight calibrations, and correlation parameters as are used in the sensitivities-based method for market risk, with necessary adjustments for the SA- CVA\u2019s reduced granularity of market risk \nfactors. \nIn contrast to market risk factors that driv e exposure, CVA sensitivities to counterparty \ncredit spreads can be calculated based on a single regulatory CVA calculation. In the \ncounterparty credit spread risk class, the SA-CVA  would use the same granularity of risk factors \nas are used in the sensitivities-based method for market risk. Vega and curvature calculations would not be required in the counterparty cred it spread risk class because regulatory CVA would \nbe approximately linear with respect to coun terparty credit spreads. For counterparty credit \nspreads, the SA-CVA would adjust risk buckets and correlations based on the role that counterparty credit spreads play in CVA calculations. \ni. Regulatory CVA \nUnder the proposal, the aggregate regulatory CVA would equal the simple sum of \ncounterparty-level regulatory CVAs. Counterparty-level regulatory CVA is intended to reflect an estimate of the market expectation of future loss that a banking organization would incur on its portfolio of derivatives with a counterparty in th e event of the counterparty\u2019s default, assuming \nthat the banking organization survives until the maturity of the longest instrument in the \nportfolio.

In addition to the three specified inputs, the proposal would also allow a banking organization to use models that incorporate additional inputs for purposes of calculating regulatory CVA. \nI.

To be able to use the fundamental analysis of credit risk or similar approaches, a banking organization would need the prior approval of its primary Federal supervisor and be subject to supervisory review of its policies and procedures that reasonably demonstrate that the \nanalysis of credit risk produces a credible p roxy of the credit spread of the counterparty.

Simulated paths of discounted future exposure \nTo align regulatory CVA with industry practice s, the regulatory CVA calculation in the \nSA-CVA would generally be based on the exposure models that a banking organization uses to calculate CVA for purposes of financial reporti ng.

Reference credit spread risk would be defined as the risk of \nloss that could arise from changes in the underlying credit spread risk factors that drive the exposure component of CVA risk. For example, a banking organization could have a portfolio of \nderivatives with Firm X as a counterparty and, at the same time, have a CDS referencing credit of Firm X in a portfolio of derivatives with Fi rm Y. In such cases, under the SA-CVA, the same \ncredit spreads of Firm X would be treated as distinct risk factors in two sets of sensitivity calculations: one within the counterparty credit spread risk class calculations, and the other within the reference credit spread risk class calculations. To incorporate credit spread hedges of CVA risk properly, each such hedge would be designated as either a counterparty credit spread \nhedge or a reference credit spread hedge and included only in one calculation according to the \ndesignation. \nEach risk class used for delta would also apply to vega, except for counterparty credit \nspread risk. The regulatory CVA is approximately li near in counterparty credit spreads and does \nnot depend on their volatilities. Accordingly, calculation of the CVA vega capital requirement \nwould not be required in the counterparty credit spread risk class.

For the interest rate, counterparty credit spread, and \nreference credit spread delta risk factors, the se nsitivity would equal the change in the aggregate \nregulatory CVA arising from CVA risk covered po sitions and separately the market value of all \nthe MPoR for a margined portfolio). Since the price of an option depends both on the price and \nvolatility of the underlying asset, both delta and vega risk factor sensitivities materially \ncontribute to expected exposure variability, ev en when the portfolio of CVA risk covered \npositions with a counterparty does not include options. \n452 As previously noted, for the sensitivity calcula tion, a banking organization would be able to \nuse either the standard risk factor shifts or smaller  values of risk factor changes, if such smaller \nvalues are consistent with those used by the banking organization for internal risk management \n(for example, using infinitesimal values of risk factor shifts in combination with algorithmic differentiation techniques). \nPage 473 of 1089 "}

Risk buckets, risk weights, and correlations \nAs noted above, there are six risk classes for delta risk factors in the SA-CVA: \ncounterparty credit spread risk class and the five risk classes for market risk factors that drive \nexpected exposure (interest rate, foreign exch ange, reference credit spread, equity, and \ncommodity). In addition, there are five exposure- related risk classes for vega risk factors. The \ngranularity of risk factors in the counterparty credit spread risk class matches the one in the non-\nsecuritization credit spread risk class in the sens itivities-based method for market risk, while the \ngranularity of both delta and vega risk factors in the exposure-related ri sk classes is greatly \nreduced. \nA. Exposure-related risk classes \nThe exposure component of regulatory CVA of a portfolio of CVA risk covered positions \nis affected by delta and vega market risk fact ors in a similar way as a portfolio of options on \nfuture market values (or their increments). Therefore, there is no compelling reason for the exposure-related risk classes in the SA-CVA to deviate from the bucket structure, risk weights, \nand correlations used in the corresponding risk classes in the sensitivities-based method for market risk, except for accommodating the reduced granularity of exposure-related risk factors in the SA-CVA. Accordingly, for both delta and vega risk factors in the exposure-related risk classes, the SA-CVA would use the bucket structur e that matches the bucket structure of the \ncorresponding risk classes in the sensitivities-b ased method for market risk. Furthermore, the \nproposal would set the values of all cross-bucket correlations, \u07db\n\u0bd5\u0bd6, used for aggregation of \nPage 480 of 1089 "}

Therefore, in contrast to the sensitivities-based method for market risk, the SA-CVA does not \nneed to provide intra-bucket correlations, \u07e9\n\u0bde\u0bdf, for these risk classes. Furthermore, because the \nsensitivities-based method for market risk provides no more than one risk weight per risk bucket \nfor the corresponding risk classes (foreign exchange, non-securitization credit spread, equity, and \ncommodity), the SA-CVA would generally match the values of these risk weights for both delta \nand vega risk factors.456 \nFor the interest rate risk class, similar to the market risk, the SA-CVA would have two \ngroups of risk buckets/currencies: the \u201cspecified\u201d  currencies (USD, EUR, GBP, AUD, CAD, \nSEK, and JPY) and the other currencies.

{"doc_name": "file-2", "page_num": 491, "page_content": "  \n The agencies assessed the impact of the proposal on banking organization capital \nrequirements and its likely effect on economic a ctivity and resilience. The proposal is expected \nto strengthen risk-based capital requirements for large banking organizations by improving their \ncomprehensiveness and risk sensitivity. Better alignment between capital requirements and risk-\ntaking helps to ensure that banks internalize the ri sk of their operations. The agencies expect that \nthe benefits of strengthening risk-based capital requirements for large banking organizations \noutweigh the costs. \nUnder the proposal, capital requirements for lending activities would be determined by a \ncombination of the credit risk and operational risk frameworks. This would have the effect of modestly increasing capital requirements for lending activity. Although a slight reduction in \nbank lending could result from the increase in capital requirements, the economic cost of this reduction would be more than offset by the expected economic benefits associated with the \nincreased resiliency of the financial system. Additionally, the relative capital requirements \nassociated with different types of bank lending would change slightly, which could lead to small \nchanges in loan portfolio allocations.  \nCapital requirements for trading activities w ould be determined by the market risk, CVA \nrisk, and operational risk frameworks, and are estimated to increase substantially, though the \nspecific outcome will depend on banking organizations \u2019 implementation of internal models. The \nproposed market risk framework would capture a larger range of risks and improve the resiliency of banking organizations relative to the curren t capital rule, although it could also increase \nbanking or ganizations\u2019 costs of engaging in market making activities. \nPage 491 of 1089 "}

It  then discusses the economic impact of the \nproposal \u2014cost and benefits \u2014on lending activity and trading activity respectively. This section \nconcludes with a discussion of the impact of the proposal on other connected rules and regulations. \nA. Scope and data \nThe proposal would apply revised capital requ irements to banking organizations subject \nto Category I, II, III, or IV capital standards, and to banking organizations with significant \ntrading activity, while retaining the current U. S. standardized approach for all banking \norganizations. As of December 31, 2022, there were  37 top-tier U.S. depository institution \nholding companies and 62 U.S.-based depository institutions that report risk-based capital \nfigures and are subject to Category I, II, III, or IV standards. The 37 top-tier depository \ninstitution holding companies include 25 U.S.- domiciled holding companies (8 in Category I, 1 \nin Category II, 5 in Category III, and 11 in Category IV) and 12 U.S. intermediate holding \ncompanies of foreign banking organizations (6 in Category III and 6 in Category IV).  \nTo estimate the impact of the proposal on these large banking organizations, the agencies \nutilized data collected in Quantitative Impact Study (QIS) reports from the Basel III monitoring \nexercises as well as regulatory financial repo rts (Call Report, FR Y-9C, FR Y-14, and FFIEC \n101). The year-end 2021 reports are used for es timating the impact of the proposal on risk-\nweighted assets calculation and its consequence on capital requirements and potential capital \nPage 492 of 1089 "}

Economic impact on lending activity \nThis subsection discusses the proposal\u2019s potential impact on lending. Lending activity \ncreates credit risk-weighted assets and increases banking organizations\u2019 net interest income, \nwhich is a significant driver of operational risk -weighted assets under the expanded risk-based \napproach. Therefore, the agenci es quantified how the proposal would impact risk-weighted \nassets associated with lending activity by adding ch anges to credit risk-weighted assets and the \ninterest income-related part of op erational risk-weighted assets. \nThe agencies estimate that risk-weighted assets (RWA) associated with banking \norganizations\u2019 lending activities would increase by $380 billion for holding companies subject to \nCategory I, II, III, or IV capital standards due to the proposal. This increase is roughly equivalent \nto an increase of 30 basis points in required risk-based capital ratios across large banking organizations. While this increase in requiremen ts could lead to a modest reduction in bank \nlending, with possible implications for economic growth, the benefits of making the financial system more resilient to stresses that could otherwise impair growth are greater.\n471 Historical \nexperience has demonstrated the severe impact  that distress or failure at individual banking \norganizations can have on the stability of the U.S. banking system, in particular banking \n471 See Macroeconomic Assessment Group, 2010, \u201cAssessing the macroeconomic impact of the \ntransition to stronger capital and liquidity requirements,\u201d Final Report ; Brooke, Martin et al., \n2015, \u201cMeasuring the macroeconomic costs and benefits of higher UK bank capital \nrequirements,\u201d Bank of England Financial Stability Paper  35; Slovik, Patrick and Boris \nCourn\u00e8de, 2011, \u201cMacroeconomic Impact of Basel III\u201d, OECD Economics Department Working \nPapers  844; Firestone, Lorenc, and Ranish (2019). \nPage 499 of 1089 "}

Enhanced \nresilience of the banking sector supports more stable lending through the economic cycle and \ndiminishes the likelihood of financial crises and their associated costs. \nSimilarly, while increases in market risk capital requirements could have some spillover \nimpact on lending, increases in capital requirements in general should also enhance the resilience \nof the banking system, supporting lending and economic activity in downturns. \nThe agencies further analyzed asset class-level funding costs and incentives for \nreallocation within banking organizations\u2019 lendi ng activities.

Additional impact considerations \nIn addition to the impact on risk-weighted a ssets examined in previous subsections, the \nproposal would also affect large banking organizations through changes in the calculation of regulatory capital, total loss-absorbing capacity (TLAC) and long-term debt (LTD) requirements, \nsingle counter-party credit limits, as w ell as the calculation of method 2 GSIB scores. \nFirst, the proposal would revise the regulatory capital calculation of banking \norganizations subject to Category III or IV cap ital standards through the recognition of AOCI \nand the application of lower deduction thresholds. Under the current capital framework, most banking organizations subject to Category III or IV capital standards have opted to exclude \nAOCI from their regulatory capital. The proposal would withdraw this option and require AOCI \nto be included in regulatory capital. \nNotably, for holding companies subject to Cate gory III or IV capital standards that opted \nout of the AOCI inclusion, the majority (at the e nd of 2022, more than 80 percent) of AOCI is \nattributable to substantial unrealized losses on c urrent or former available-for-sale securities. \nCapital market and yield curve developments can at  times lead to substantial AOCI fluctuation. \nIn recent years, the aggregate AOCI related to  the security holdings of holding companies \nsubject to Category III or IV capital standard s fluctuated between an unrealized gain of \n695\u2013731.

Therefore, the agencies assessed the impact of \nAOCI inclusion and threshold deduction changes from a long-run perspective, which provides a \nmore representative measure of the risk and portfolio management practices of banking \norganizations over time. \nThe agencies used quarterly FR Y-9C data from 2015 Q1 to 2022 Q4 to estimate the \neffect of AOCI recognition and quarterly FR Y-14Q data from 2020 Q3 to 2022 Q4 for the estimation of the threshold deduction effect. The impact of the proposal would generally be driven by the AOCI recognition, albeit threshold deduction changes would dominate for the U.S. intermediate holding companies of foreign banking organizations subject to Category III \ncapital standards. The differential impact holds f or both risk-based capital and leverage ratios. \nThe agencies estimate that the average long-run effect of both proposed changes on domestic \nholding companies subject to Category III standards would be equivalent to a 4.6-percent and \n3.8-percent relative increase in the common equi ty tier 1 and leverage capital requirements, \nrespectively. For the U.S. intermediate holding companies of foreign banking organizations \nsubject to Category III capital standards, the average long-run effect of both proposed changes \nwould be equivalent to a 13.2-percent and 9.7- percent relative increase in the respective \nrequirements. For the holding companies of ba nking organizations subject to Category IV capital \nstandards, the average long-run ef fect of both proposed changes would be equivalent to a 2.6-\npercent and 2.5-percent relative increase in the respective capital requirements. Finally, if affected banking organizations do not adjust their AOCI management, for example by adjusting the relative size, fair value hedging, or interest ra te sensitivity of their available-for-sale security \nportfolios, AOCI recognition could increase variati on in regulatory capital ratios over time and \nmake them more correlated with market cycles. \nPage 505 of 1089 "}

Technical amendments to the capital rule \nThe proposal would make certain technical corr ections and clarifications to several \nprovisions of the capital rule, as described below. Most of these proposed corrections or \ntechnical changes are self-explanatory, such as u pdates to terminology to align with the proposal, \nand would apply only to banking organizations that would be subject to subpart E. In addition, \nthere are several transition provisions and tempora ry provisions that have expired or no longer \napply that the proposal would remove from the capital rule.

Also, the proposal would make certain technical corrections to the rule to address errors, such updating the \nnumbering of footnotes in certain sections and correcting the definiti on of qualifying master \nPage 507 of 1089 "}

Under the proposed \nrule, a banking organization subject to Category I, II, III or IV standards would be required to \ncalculate its risk-based capital ratios under both the new expanded risk-based approach and the \ncurrent, generally applicable standardized app roach, and the lower of the two for each ratio \nwould be binding. In addition, all capital buffer requirements, incl uding the stress capital buffer, \nwould apply regardless of whether the expanded ri sk-based approach or the existing standardized \napproach produces the binding ratio. \nSince the binding capital ratios could be based on either the standardized approach or the \nexpanded risk-based approach, banking organizations would be required to calculate both version of capital ratios and capital buffer s under the proposed rule. To allow banking \norganizations to report values using either ca lculation method, the Board proposes to revise FR \nY-14A, Schedule A.1.d (Capital) to require banking organizations subject to Category I, II, or III standards to report certain items depending on which common equity tier 1 ratio is binding as of \nthe report date.
