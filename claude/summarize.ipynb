The docket may be viewed after the close of the\\ncomment period in the same manner.\\nI.\\nIntroduction\\nThe Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), the Board of Governors of the\\nFederal Reserve System (Board), and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC)\\n(collectively, the agencies) are proposing to modify the capital requirements applicable to\\nbanking organizations\\xc2\\xb9 with total assets of $100 billion or more and their subsidiary depository\\ninstitutions (large banking organizations) and to banking organizations with significant trading\\nactivity. The revisions set forth in the proposal would strengthen the calculation of risk-based\\ncapital requirements to better reflect the risks of these banking organizations\\' exposures. In\\naddition, the proposed revisions would enhance the consistency of requirements across large\\nbanking organizations and facilitate more effective supervisory and market assessments of\\ncapital adequacy.\\nFollowing the 2007-09 financial crisis, the agencies adopted an initial set of reforms to\\nimprove the effectiveness of and address weaknesses in the regulatory capital framework. For\\nexample, in 2013, the agencies adopted a final rule that increased the quantity and quality of\\nregulatory capital banking organizations must maintain.\\xc2\\xb2 These changes were broadly consistent\\n1 The term \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbanking organizations\\xe2\\x80\\x9d includes national banks, state member banks, state\\nnonmember banks, federal savings associations, state savings associations, top-tier bank holding\\ncompanies domiciled in the United States not subject to the Board\\'s Small Bank Holding\\nCompany and Savings and Loan Holding Company Policy Statement (12 CFR part 225,\\nappendix C), U.S. intermediate holding companies of foreign banking organizations, and top-tier\\nsavings and loan holding companies domiciled in the United States, except for certain savings\\nand loan holding companies that are substantially engaged in insurance underwriting or\\ncommercial activities and savings and loan holding companies that are subject to the Small Bank\\nHolding Company and Savings and Loan Holding Company Policy Statement.\\n2 The Board and the OCC issued a joint final rule on October 11, 2013 (78 FR 62018) and the\\nFDIC issued a substantially identical interim final rule on September 10, 2013 (78 FR 55340). In\\nApril 2014, the FDIC adopted the interim final rule as a final rule with no substantive changes.\\n79 FR 20754 (April 14, 2014).\\nPage 10 of 1089\\nwith an initial set of reforms published by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel\\nCommittee) following the financial crisis.\\xc2\\xb3 The Board also implemented capital planning and\\nstress testing requirements for large bank holding companies and savings and loan holding\\ncompanies and an additional capital buffer requirement to mitigate the financial stability risks\\nposed by U.S. global systemically important banking organizations (GSIBs),5 as well as other\\nenhanced prudential standards, consistent with the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and\\nConsumer Protection Act of 2010 (Dodd-Frank Act).\"\\nThe proposal would build on these initial reforms by making additional changes\\ndeveloped in response to the 2007-09 financial crisis and informed by experience since the crisis.\\nRequirements under the proposal would generally be consistent with international capital\\nstandards issued by the Basel Committee, commonly known as the Basel III reforms.7 Where\\nappropriate, the proposal differs from the Basel III reforms to reflect, for example, specific\\ncharacteristics of U.S. markets, requirements under U.S. generally accepted accounting\\nprinciples (GAAP), practices of U.S. banking organizations, and U.S. legal requirements and\\npolicy objectives.\\nThe proposal would strengthen risk-based capital requirements for large banking\\norganizations by improving their comprehensiveness and risk sensitivity. These proposed\\n3 The Basel Committee is a committee composed of central banks and banking supervisory\\nauthorities, which was established by the central bank governors of the G-10 countries in 1975.\\n4 See 12 CFR 225.8; 12 CFR 238, subparts N, O, P, R, S; 12 CFR 252, subparts D, E, F, N, O.\\n5\\n12 CFR part 217, subpart H.\\n6 See 12 CFR part 252; 12 U.S.C. \\xc2\\xa7 5365.\\n7\\nSee the consolidated Basel Framework at https:/www.bis.org/basel_framework/.\\n8 GAAP often serve as a foundational measurement component for U.S. capital requirements.\\nPage 11 of 1089\\nrevisions, including removal of certain internal models, would increase capital requirements in\\nthe aggregate, in particular for those banking organizations with heightened risk profiles.\\nIncreased capital requirements can produce both economic costs and benefits. The agencies\\nassessed the likely effect of the proposal on economic activity and resilience, and expect that the\\nbenefits of strengthening capital requirements for large banking organizations outweigh the\\ncosts.\\xe2\\x81\\xb9\\nHistorical experience has demonstrated the impact individual banking organizations can\\nhave on the stability of the U.S. banking system, in particular banking organizations that would\\nhave been subject to the proposal. Large banking organizations that experience an increase in\\ntheir capital requirements resulting from the proposal would be expected to be able to absorb\\nlosses with reduced disruption to financial intermediation in the U.S. economy. Enhanced\\nresilience of the banking sector supports more stable lending through the economic cycle and\\ndiminishes the likelihood of financial crises and their associated costs.\\nThe agencies seek comment on all aspects of the proposal.\\nA. Overview of the proposal\\nThe proposal would improve the risk capture and consistency of capital requirements\\nacross large banking organizations and reduce complexity and operational costs through changes\\nacross multiple areas of the agencies\\' risk-based capital framework. For most parts of the\\nframework, the proposal would eliminate the use of banking organizations\\' internal models to set\\nregulatory capital requirements and in their place apply a simpler and more consistent\\nstandardized framework. For market risk, the proposal would retain banking organizations\\'\\n9 See the impact and economic analysis presented in section V of this Supplementary\\nInformation.\\nPage 12 of 1089\\nability to use internal models, with an improved models-based measure for market risk that better\\naccounts for potential losses. The use of internal models would be subject to enhanced\\nrequirements for model approval and performance and a new \"output floor\" to limit the extent to\\nwhich a banking organization\\'s internal models may reduce its overall capital requirement. The\\nproposal would also adopt new standardized approaches for market risk and credit valuation\\nadjustment (CVA) risk that better reflect the risks of banking organizations\\' exposures.\\nThis new framework for calculating risk-weighted assets (the expanded risk-based\\napproach) would apply to banking organizations with total assets of $100 billion or more and\\ntheir subsidiary depository institutions. The revised requirements for market risk would also\\napply to other banking organizations with $5 billion or more in trading assets plus trading\\nliabilities or for which trading assets plus trading liabilities exceed 10 percent of total assets.\\nThe expanded risk-based approach would be more risk-sensitive than the current U.S.\\nstandardized approach by incorporating more credit-risk drivers (for example, borrower and loan\\ncharacteristics) and explicitly differentiating between more types of risk (for example,\\noperational risk, credit valuation adjustment risk). In this manner, the expanded risk-based\\napproach would better account for key risks faced by large banking organizations. The proposed\\nchanges would also enhance the alignment of capital requirements to the risks of banking\\norganizations\\' exposures and increase incentives for prudent risk management.\\nTo ensure that large banking organizations would not have lower capital requirements\\nthan smaller, less complex banking organizations, the proposal would maintain the capital rule\\'s\\ndual-requirement structure. Under this structure, a large banking organization would be required\\nto calculate its risk-based capital ratios under both the new expanded risk-based approach and the\\nstandardized approach (including market risk, as applicable), and use the lower of the two for\\nPage 13 of 1089\\n10\\neach risk-based capital ratio. \\xc2\\xb90 All capital buffer requirements, including the stress capital buffer\\nrequirement, would apply regardless of whether the expanded risk-based approach or the existing\\nstandardized approach produces the lower ratio.\\nFor banking organizations subject to Category III or IV capital standards,\\xc2\\xb9\\xc2\\xb9 the proposal\\nwould align the calculation of regulatory capital \\xe2\\x80\\x93 the numerator of the regulatory capital ratios \\xe2\\x80\\x94\\nwith the calculation for banking organizations subject to Category I or II capital standards,\\nproviding the same approach for all large banking organizations. Banking organizations subject\\nto Category III or IV capital standards would be subject to the same treatment of accumulated\\nother comprehensive income (AOCI), capital deductions, and rules for minority interest as\\nbanking organizations subject to Category I or II capital standards. This change would help\\nensure that the regulatory capital ratios of these banking organizations better reflect their\\ncapacity to absorb losses, including by taking into account unrealized losses or gains on\\nsecurities positions reflected in AOCI.\\n10 Banking organizations\\' risk-based capital ratios are the common equity tier 1 capital ratio,\\ntier 1 capital ratio, and total capital ratio. See 12 CFR 3.10 (OCC), 12 CFR 217.10 (Board), and\\n12 CFR 324.10 (FDIC).\\n11 In 2019, the agencies adopted rules establishing four categories of capital standards for U.S.\\nbanking organizations with $100 billion or more in total assets and foreign banking organizations\\nwith $100 billion or more in combined U.S. assets. Under this framework, Category I capital\\nstandards apply to U.S. global systemically important bank holding companies and their\\ndepository institution subsidiaries. Category II capital standards apply to banking organizations\\nwith at least $700 billion in total consolidated assets or at least $75 billion in cross-jurisdictional\\nactivity and their depository institution subsidiaries. Category III capital standards apply to\\nbanking organizations with total consolidated assets of at least $250 billion or at least $75 billion\\nin weighted short-term wholesale funding, nonbank assets, or off-balance sheet exposure and\\ntheir depository institution subsidiaries. Category IV capital standards apply to banking\\norganizations with total consolidated assets of at least $100 billion that do not meet the\\nthresholds for a higher category and their depository institution subsidiaries. See 12 CFR 3.2\\n(OCC), 12 CFR 252.5, 12 CFR 238.10 (Board), 12 CFR 324.2 (FDIC); \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPrudential Standards for\\nLarge Bank Holding Companies, Savings and Loan Holding Companies, and Foreign Banking\\nOrganizations,\" 84 FR 59032 (November 1, 2019); and \"Changes to Applicability Thresholds for\\nRegulatory Capital and Liquidity Requirements,\" 84 FR 59230 (November 1, 2019).\\nPage 14 of 1089\\nThe proposal would expand application of the supplementary leverage ratio and the\\ncountercyclical capital buffer to banking organizations subject to Category IV capital standards.\\nThis change would bring further alignment of capital requirements across large banking\\norganizations and is consistent with the proposal\\'s goal of strengthening the resilience of large\\nbanking organizations.\\nThe proposal would also introduce enhanced disclosure requirements to facilitate market\\nparticipants\\' understanding of a banking organization\\'s financial condition and risk management\\npractices. Also, the proposal would align Federal Reserve\\'s regulatory reporting requirements\\nwith the changes to capital requirements. The agencies anticipate that revisions to the reporting\\nforms of the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC) applicable to large\\nbanking organizations and to banking organizations with significant trading activity will be\\nproposed in the near future, which would align with the proposed revisions to the capital rule.\\nThe proposed changes would take effect subject to the transition provisions described in\\nsection IV of this Supplementary Information.\\nThe revisions introduced by the proposal would interact with several Board rules,\\nincluding by modifying the risk-weighted assets used to calculate total loss-absorbing capacity\\nrequirements, long-term debt requirements, and the short-term wholesale funding score included\\nin the GSIB surcharge method 2 score. Also, the proposal would revise the calculation of single-\\ncounterparty credit limits by removing the option of using a banking organization\\'s internal\\nmodels to calculate derivatives exposure amounts and requiring the use of the standardized\\napproach for counterparty credit risk for this purpose. The proposal would also remove the\\nexemption from calculating risk-weighted assets under subpart E of the capital rule currently\\nPage 15 of 1089\\navailable to U.S. intermediate holding companies of foreign banking organizations under the\\nBoard\\'s enhanced prudential standards.\\nIn parallel, the Board is issuing a notice of proposed rulemaking revising the GSIB\\nsurcharge calculation applicable to GSIBs and the systemic risk report applicable to large\\nbanking organizations.\\xc2\\xb92\\nQuestion 1: The Board invites comment on the interaction of the revisions under the\\nproposal with other existing rules and with the other notice of proposed rulemaking. In\\nparticular, comment is invited on the impact of the proposal on the single-counterparty credit\\nlimit framework. What are the advantages and disadvantages of the proposed approach? Which\\nalternatives, if any, should the Board consider and why?\\nB. Use of internal models under the proposed framework\\nThe proposal would remove the use of internal models to set credit risk and operational\\nrisk capital requirements (the so-called advanced approaches) for banking organizations subject\\nto Category I or II capital standards. These internal models rely on a banking organization\\'s\\nchoice of modeling assumptions and supporting data. Such model assumptions include a degree\\nof subjectivity, which can result in varying risk-based capital requirements for similar exposures.\\nMoreover, empirical verification of modeling choices can require many years of historical\\nexperience because severe credit risk and operational risk losses can occur infrequently. In the\\nagencies\\' previous observations, the advanced approaches have produced unwarranted variability\\n\\xc2\\xb92 [On October 24, 2019, the Board published in the Federal Register a notice of proposed\\nrulemaking inviting comment on a proposal to establish risk-based capital requirements for\\ndepository institution holding companies significantly engaged in insurance activities. See 84 FR\\n57240 (October 24, 2019). The Board anticipates that any final rule based on the proposal in this\\nSupplementary Information would include appropriate adjustments as necessary to take into\\naccount any final insurance capital rule.]\\nPage 16 of 1089\\nacross banking organizations in requirements for exposures with similar risks.\\xc2\\xb9\\xc2\\xb3 This\\nunwarranted variability, combined with the complexity of these models-based approaches, can\\nreduce confidence in the validity of the modeled outputs, lessen the transparency of the risk-\\nbased capital ratios, and challenge comparisons of capital adequacy across banking\\norganizations.\\nStandardization of credit and operational risk capital requirements would improve the\\nconsistency of requirements. Standardized requirements, together with robust public disclosure\\nand reporting requirements, would enhance the transparency of capital requirements and the\\nability of supervisors and market participants to make independent assessments of a banking\\norganization\\'s capital adequacy, individually and relative to its peers.\\nThe use of robust, risk-sensitive standardized approaches for credit and operational risk\\nwould also improve the efficiency of the capital framework by reducing operational costs. Under\\nthe advanced approaches, banking organizations subject to Category I or II capital standards\\nmust develop and maintain internal modeling systems to determine capital requirements, which\\nmay differ from the risk measurement approaches they use to monitor risk for internal\\nassessments. Further, any material changes to a banking organization\\'s internal models must be\\nfully documented and presented to the banking organization\\'s primary federal supervisor for\\nreview.\\xc2\\xb94 Replacing the use of internal models with standardized approaches would reduce costs\\nassociated with maintaining such modeling systems and eliminate the associated submissions to\\nthe agencies.\\n14\\n13 The Basel Committee has published analysis illustrating the variability of credit-risk-weighted\\nassets across banking organizations. See https://www.bis.org/publ/bcbs256.pdf and\\nhttps://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d363.pdf.\\n14\\nSee 12 CFR 3.123(a) (OCC); 12 CFR 217.123(a) (Board); 12 CFR 324.123(a) (FDIC).\\nPage 17 of 1089\\n15\\n16\\nEliminating the use of internal models to set credit and operational risk capital\\nrequirements would not reduce the overall risk capture of the regulatory framework. In addition\\nto the calculation of expanded risk-based approach and standardized approach capital\\nrequirements, a large banking organization would continue to be required to maintain capital\\ncommensurate with the level and nature of all risks to which the banking organization is\\nexposed, \\xc2\\xb95 to have a process for assessing its overall capital adequacy in relation to its risk\\nprofile and a comprehensive strategy for maintaining an appropriate level of capital,\\xc2\\xb96 and, where\\napplicable, to conduct internal stress tests. \\xc2\\xb97 Also, holding companies subject to the Board\\'s\\ncapital plan rule would continue to be subject to a stress capital buffer requirement that is based\\non a supervisory stress test of the holding company\\'s exposures. \\xc2\\xb98 Although the proposal would\\nremove use of internal models for calculating capital requirements for credit and operational risk,\\ninternal models can provide valuable information to a banking organization\\'s internal stress\\ntesting, capital planning, and risk management functions. Large banking organizations should\\nemploy internal modeling capabilities as appropriate for the complexity of their activities.\\n17\\n18\\nThe proposal would continue to allow use of internal models to set market risk capital\\nrequirements for portfolios where modeling can be demonstrated to be appropriate. In addition,\\nthe proposal would provide for conservative but risk-sensitive standardized alternatives where\\nmodeling is not supported. In contrast to credit and operational risk, market risk data allows for\\ndaily feedback on model performance to support empirical verification. The proposal would limit\\nthe use of models to only those trading desks for which a banking organization has received\\n15 See 12 CFR 3.10(e)(1) (OCC); 12 CFR 217.10(e)(1) (Board); 12 CFR 324.10(e)(1) (FDIC).\\n16 See 12 CFR 3.10(e)(2) (OCC); 12 CFR 217.10(e)(2) (Board); 12 CFR 324.10(e)(2) (FDIC).\\n17 See 12 CFR 46 (OCC); 12 CFR 252 subpart B and F (Board); 12 CFR 325 (FDIC).\\n18\\nSee 12 CFR 225.8 and 12 CFR 238.170.\\nPage 18 of 1089\\napproval from its primary federal supervisor. Ongoing use of such models would depend upon a\\nbanking organization\\'s ability to demonstrate through robust testing that the models are\\nsufficiently conservative and accurate for purposes of calculating market risk capital\\nrequirements. In cases where a banking organization cannot demonstrate acceptable performance\\nof its internal models for a given trading desk, the banking organization would be required to use\\nthe standardized measure for market risk which acts as a risk-sensitive alternative.\\nII. Scope of application\\nThe proposal\\'s expanded risk-based approach would apply to banking organizations with\\ntotal assets of $100 billion or more and their subsidiary depository institutions.\\xc2\\xb99 These banking\\norganizations are large and exhibit heightened complexity. Application of the expanded risk-\\nbased approach to large banking organizations would provide granular, generally standardized\\nrequirements that result in robust risk capture and appropriate risk sensitivity. By strengthening\\nthe requirements that apply to large banking organizations, the proposal would enhance their\\nresilience and reduce risks to U.S. financial stability and costs they may pose to the Federal\\nDeposit Insurance Fund in case of material distress or failure. Relative to smaller, less complex\\nbanking organizations, these banking organizations have greater operational capacity to apply\\nmore sophisticated requirements.\\nPreviously, the agencies determined that the advanced approaches requirements should\\nnot apply to banking organizations subject to Category III or IV capital standards, as the agencies\\nconsidered such requirements to be overly complex and burdensome relative to the safety and\\n19 The proposal would also apply to depository institutions with total assets of $100 billion or\\nmore that are not consolidated subsidiaries of depository institution holding companies, and to\\ndepository institutions with total assets of $100 billion or more that are subsidiaries of depository\\ninstitution holding companies that are not assigned a category under the capital rule.\\nPage 19 of 1089\\nsoundness benefits that they would provide for these banking organizations.20 The expanded\\nrisk-based approach generally is based on standardized requirements, which would be less\\ncomplex and costly. In addition, recent events demonstrate the impact banking organizations\\nsubject to Category III or IV capital standards can have on financial stability. While the recent\\nfailure of banking organizations subject to Category IV capital standards may be attributed to a\\nvariety of factors, the effect of these failures on financial stability supports further alignment of\\nthe regulatory capital framework across large banking organizations.\\nBanking organizations with significant trading activities are subject to substantial market\\nrisk and, therefore, would be subject to market risk capital requirements. Recognizing that the\\ndollar-based threshold for the application of market risk requirements was established in 1996,\\nthe proposal would increase this dollar-based threshold from $1 billion to $5 billion of trading\\nassets plus trading liabilities. Banking organizations would also continue to be subject to market\\nrisk requirements if their trading assets plus trading liabilities represent 10 percent or more of\\ntotal assets. The proposal would revise the calculation of the dollar-based threshold amount to be\\nbased on four-quarter averages of trading assets and trading liabilities instead of point-in-time\\namounts. Banking organizations that would no longer meet these minimum thresholds for being\\nsubject to market risk capital requirements would calculate risk-weighted assets for trading\\nexposures under the standardized approach. Additionally, under the proposal, large banking\\norganizations would be subject to market risk capital requirements regardless of trading\\nactivities.\\n20 See \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPrudential Standards for Large Bank Holding Companies, Savings and Loan Holding\\nCompanies, and Foreign Banking Organizations,\" 84 FR 59032 (November 1, 2019).\\nPage 20 of 1089\\nThe proposal would expand application of the countercyclical capital buffer to banking\\norganizations subject to Category IV capital standards. The countercyclical capital buffer is a\\nmacroprudential tool that can be used to increase the resilience of the financial system by\\nincreasing capital requirements for large banking organizations during a period of elevated risk\\nof above-normal losses. Failure or distress of a banking organization with assets of $100 billion\\nor more during a time of elevated risk or stress can have significant destabilizing effects for other\\nbanking organizations and the broader financial system - even if the banking organization does\\nnot meet the criteria for being subject to Category II or III capital standards. Applying the\\ncountercyclical capital buffer to banking organizations subject to Category IV capital standards\\nwould increase the resilience of these banking organizations and, in turn, improve the resilience\\nof the broader financial system. The proposed approach also has the potential to moderate\\nfluctuations in the supply of credit over time. The proposal would also modify how the\\ncountercyclical capital buffer amount is determined to reflect the proposed changes to market\\nrisk capital requirements. Specifically, the risk-weighted asset amount for private sector credit\\nexposures that are market risk covered positions under the proposal would be determined using\\nthe standardized default risk capital requirement for such positions rather than using the specific\\nrisk add-on of the current rule.\\nThe proposal also would expand application of the supplementary leverage ratio\\nrequirement to banking organizations subject to Category IV capital standards. In contrast to the\\nrisk-based capital requirements, a leverage ratio does not differentiate the amount of capital\\nrequired by exposure type. Rather, a leverage ratio puts a simple and transparent limit on\\nbanking organization leverage. Leverage requirements protect against underestimation of risk\\nboth by banking organizations and by risk-based capital requirements and serve as a complement\\nPage 21 of 1089\\nto risk-based capital requirements. The supplementary leverage ratio measures tier 1 capital\\nrelative to total leverage exposure, which includes on-balance sheet assets and certain off-\\nbalance sheet exposures. The proposed change would ensure that all large banking organizations\\nare subject to a consistent and robust leverage requirement that serves as a complement to risk-\\nbased capital requirements and takes into account on- and off-balance sheet exposures.\\nQuestion 2: What are the advantages and disadvantages of applying the expanded risk-\\nbased approach to banking organizations subject to Category III or IV capital standards? To\\nwhat extent is the expanded risk-based approach appropriate for banking organizations with\\ndifferent risk profiles, including from a cost and operational burden perspective? Are there\\nspecific areas, such as the market risk capital framework, for which the agencies should consider\\na materiality threshold to better balance cost and operational burden and risk sensitivity, and if\\nso what should that threshold be and why? What would the appropriate exposure treatment be\\nfor banking organizations with such exposures beneath any materiality threshold, and how\\nwould that treatment be consistent with the overall calibration of the expanded risk-based\\napproach? What alternatives, if any, should the agencies consider to help ensure that the risks of\\nlarge banking organizations are appropriately captured under minimum risk-based capital\\nrequirements and why?\\nQuestion 3: What are the advantages and disadvantages of harmonizing the calculation\\nof regulatory capital across large banking organizations? What are any unintended\\nconsequences of the proposal and what steps should the agencies consider to mitigate those\\nconsequences? What are the advantages and disadvantages of harmonizing the calculation of\\nregulatory capital across large banking organizations and using different approaches (for\\nPage 22 of 1089\\nexample, the expanded risk-based approach and the U.S. standardized approach) for the\\ncalculation of risk-weighted assets?\\nQuestion 4: What are the advantages and disadvantages of applying the countercyclical\\ncapital buffer and supplementary leverage ratio to banking organizations subject to Category IV\\ncapital standards?\\nIII. Proposed changes to the capital rule\\nA. Calculation of capital ratios and application of buffer requirements\\nUnder the proposal, large banking organizations would be required to calculate total risk-\\nweighted assets under two approaches: (1) the expanded risk-based approach, and (2) the\\nstandardized approach. Total risk-weighted assets under the expanded risk-based approach\\n(expanded total risk-weighted assets) would equal the sum of risk-weighted assets for credit risk,\\nequity risk, operational risk, market risk, and CVA risk, as described in this proposal, minus any\\namount of the banking organization\\'s adjusted allowance for credit losses that is not included in\\ntier 2 capital and any amount of allocated transfer risk reserves. For calculating standardized\\ntotal risk-weighted assets, the proposal would revise the methodology for determining market\\nrisk-weighted assets and would require banking organizations subject to Category III or IV\\ncapital standards to use the standardized approach for counterparty credit risk (SA-CCR) for\\nderivative exposures.\\n21\\n21 The proposed methodology for determining market risk-weighted assets, in certain instances,\\nwould require a banking organization that is subject to subpart E to apply risk weights from\\nsubpart D for purposes of determining its standardized total risk-weighted assets and from\\nsubpart E for purposes of determining its expanded total risk-weighted assets. This approach\\nwould apply in the case of: (i) capital add-ons for re-designations, (ii) term repo-style\\ntransactions the banking organization elects to include in market risk, (iii) the standardized\\ndefault risk capital requirement for securitization positions non-CTP, and (iv) the standardized\\ndefault risk capital requirement for correlation trading positions, each as discussed further below.\\nPage 23 of 1089\\nTo determine its applicable risk-based capital ratios, a large banking organization would\\ncalculate two sets of risk-based capital ratios (common equity tier 1 capital ratio, tier 1 capital\\nratio, and total capital ratio), one using expanded total risk-weighted assets and one using\\nstandardized total risk-weighted assets. A banking organization\\'s common equity tier 1 capital\\nratio, tier 1 capital ratio, and total capital ratio would be the lower of each ratio of the two\\napproaches.\\nThe proposal would not change the minimum risk-based capital ratios under the capital\\nrule. Also, the capital conservation buffer would continue to apply to risk-based capital ratios as\\nunder the capital rule, except that the stress capital buffer requirement a component of the\\ncapital conservation buffer that is applicable to banking organizations subject to the Board\\'s\\ncapital plan rule would apply to a banking organization\\'s risk-based capital ratios regardless of\\nwhether the ratios result from the expanded risk-based approach or the standardized approach.\\nQuestion 5: What are the advantages and disadvantages of banking organizations being\\nrequired to calculate risk-based capital ratios in two different ways and what alternatives, such\\nas a single calculation, should the agencies consider and why? What modifications, if any, to the\\nproposed structure of the risk-based capital calculation should the agencies consider?\\n1. Standardized output floor\\nTo enhance the consistency of capital requirements and ensure that the use of internal\\nmodels for market risk does not result in unwarranted reductions in capital requirements, the\\nproposal would introduce an \"output floor\" to the calculation of expanded total risk-weighted\\nassets. This output floor would correspond to 72.5 percent of the sum of a banking organization\\'s\\ncredit risk-weighted assets, equity risk-weighted assets, operational risk-weighted assets, and\\nCVA risk-weighted assets under the expanded risk-based approach and risk-weighted assets\\nPage 24 of 1089\\ncalculated using the standardized measure for market risk, minus any amount of the banking\\norganization\\'s adjusted allowance for credit losses that is not included in tier 2 capital and any\\namount of allocated transfer risk reserves.\\nRisk-weighted assets (RWA) under the output floor\\nOutput Floor = 0.725\\n* [credit RWA + equity RWA + operational RWA + CVA RWA\\n+ market RWA under the standardized measure]\\n- adjusted allowance for credit losses not included in tier 2 capital\\n- allocated transfer risk reserves\\nThe output floor would serve as a lower bound on the risk-weighted assets under the\\nexpanded risk-based approach. In other words, if the risk-weighted assets under the expanded\\nrisk-based approach were less than the output floor, the output floor would have to be used as the\\nrisk-weighted asset amount to determine the expanded risk-based approach capital ratios.\\nThe proposed calibration of the output floor aims to strike a balance between allowing\\ninternal models to enhance the risk sensitivity of market risk capital requirements and ensuring\\nthat these models would not result in unwarranted reductions in capital requirements. The output\\nfloor would be consistent with the Basel III reforms, which would promote consistency in capital\\nrequirements for large, complex, and internationally active banking organizations across\\njurisdictions.\\nQuestion 6: What are the advantages and disadvantages of the proposed output floor?\\n2. Stress capital buffer requirement\\nUnder the current capital rule, each banking organization is subject to one or more buffer\\nrequirements, and must maintain capital ratios above the sum of its minimum requirements and\\nPage 25 of 1089\\nbuffer requirements to avoid restrictions on capital distributions and certain discretionary bonus\\npayments.22 Banking organizations that are subject to the Board\\'s capital plan rule\\xc2\\xb2\\xc2\\xb3 (bank\\nholding companies, U.S. intermediate holding companies, and savings and loan holding\\ncompanies that have over $100 billion or more in total consolidated assets) are currently subject\\nto a standardized approach capital conservation buffer requirement, which is calculated as the\\nsum of the banking organization\\'s stress capital buffer requirement, applicable countercyclical\\ncapital buffer requirement, and applicable GSIB surcharge. The standardized approach capital\\nconservation buffer requirement applies to a banking organization\\'s standardized approach risk-\\nbased capital ratios. In addition, banking organizations that are subject to the capital plan rule\\nand the advanced approaches requirements are subject to an advanced approaches capital\\nconservation buffer requirement, which applies to their advanced approaches risk-based capital\\nratios, and which is calculated in the same manner as the standardized approach capital\\nconservation buffer requirement, except that the banking organization\\'s stress capital buffer\\nrequirement is replaced with a 2.5 percent buffer requirement.\\xc2\\xb2\\nThe stress capital buffer requirement integrates the results of the Board\\'s supervisory\\nstress tests with the risk-based requirements of the capital rule to determine capital distribution\\nlimitations. As a result, required capital levels for each banking organization more closely align\\nwith the banking organization\\'s risk profile and projected losses as measured by the Board\\'s\\nstress test. The stress capital buffer requirement is generally calculated as (1) the difference\\n25\\n24\\n22 12 CFR 3.11 (OCC); 12 CFR 217.11 (Board); 12 CFR 324.11 (FDIC).\\n23 12 CFR 225.8 (bank holding companies and U.S. intermediate holding companies of foreign\\nbanking organizations); 12 CFR 238.170 (savings and loan holding companies).\\n24 See 12 CFR 217.11(c).\\n25 See 85 FR 15576 (March 18, 2020).\\nPage 26 of 1089\\nbetween the banking organization\\'s starting and minimum projected common equity tier 1\\ncapital ratios under the severely adverse scenario in the supervisory stress test (stress test losses)\\nplus (2) the sum of the dollar amount of the banking organization\\'s planned common stock\\ndividends for each of the fourth through seventh quarters of the planning horizon as a percentage\\nof risk-weighted assets (dividend add-on).\\xc2\\xb26 A banking organization\\'s stress capital buffer\\nrequirement cannot be less than 2.5 percent of standardized total risk-weighted assets.\\n26\\nCurrently, the stress test losses and dividend add-on portion of the stress capital buffer\\nrequirement are calculated using only the standardized approach common equity tier 1 capital\\nratio. This is consistent with the exclusion of the stress capital buffer requirement from the\\nadvanced approaches capital conservation buffer requirement, and with the Board\\'s stress testing\\nand capital plan rules, under which banking organizations are not required to project capital\\nratios using the advanced approaches.\\nThe Board is proposing to amend its capital plan rule, stress testing rule, and the buffer\\nframework in its capital rule to take into account capital ratios calculated under the expanded\\nrisk-based approach, in addition to the standardized approach. Under the proposal, banking\\norganizations subject to the capital plan rule would be subject to a single capital conservation\\nbuffer requirement, which would include the stress capital buffer requirement, applicable\\ncountercyclical capital buffer requirement, and applicable GSIB surcharge, and would apply to\\nthe banking organization\\'s risk-based capital ratios, regardless of whether the ratios result from\\nthe expanded risk-based approach or the standardized approach. In this manner, the proposal\\nwould ensure that the stress capital buffer requirement contributes to the robustness and risk-\\nsensitivity of the risk-based capital requirements of these banking organizations. Application of\\n26 12 CFR 225.8(f)(2); 12 CFR 238.170(f)(2).\\nPage 27 of 1089\\nthe stress capital buffer requirement to the risk-based capital ratios derived from the expanded\\nrisk-based approach would not introduce complexity given the fixed balance sheet assumption\\ncurrently used in the Board stress tests and because the expanded risk-based approach is based in\\nmostly standardized requirements.27\\nAdditionally, the proposal would revise the calculation of the stress capital buffer\\nrequirement for large banking organizations. Under the proposal, both the stress test losses and\\ndividend add-on components of the stress capital buffer requirement would be calculated using\\nthe binding common equity tier 1 capital ratio, as of the final quarter of the previous capital plan\\ncycle, regardless of whether it results from the expanded risk-based approach or the standardized\\napproach.28 The proposed calculation methodology would limit complexity relative to potential\\nalternatives, such as introducing two stress capital buffer requirements for each banking\\norganization (one for each approach to calculating total risk-weighted assets). In addition, the\\nproposed approach recognizes that the binding approach for a banking organization is unlikely to\\nchange within the period in which a given stress capital buffer requirement is applicable.\\nAs part of the capital buffer framework, the stress capital buffer requirement helps ensure\\nthat a banking organization can withstand losses from a severely adverse scenario, while still\\nmeeting its minimum regulatory capital requirements and thereby continuing to serve as a viable\\n27\\nInitially, the Board did not incorporate the stress capital buffer requirement into the advanced\\napproaches capital conservation buffer requirement owing to the complexity involved in doing\\nSO.\\n28 The Board\\'s Stress Testing Policy Statement includes an assumption that the magnitude of a\\nbanking organization\\'s balance sheet will be fixed throughout the projection horizon under the\\nsupervisory stress test. 12 CFR part 252, Appendix B. Under this assumption, because the\\ndenominators of the common equity tier 1 capital ratios as calculated under the standardized\\napproach and the expanded risk-based approach would remain the same throughout the stress\\ntest, the approach under which the binding common equity tier 1 capital ratio is calculated would\\nremain the same throughout the final quarter of the previous capital plan cycle and the projection\\nhorizon.\\nPage 28 of 1089\\nfinancial intermediary. Because this proposal aims to better reflect the risk of banking\\norganizations\\' exposures in the calculation of risk-weighted assets, without changing the targeted\\nlevel of conservatism of the minimum capital requirements, the Board is not proposing\\nassociated changes to the targeted severity of the stress capital buffer requirement. The Board\\nevaluates the minimum risk-based capital requirements, which are largely determined by risk-\\nweighted assets, and the stress capital buffer requirement individually for their specific intended\\npurposes in the capital framework, and holistically as they determine the aggregate capital\\nbanking organizations hold in the normal course of business.\\nIn addition to revising the stress capital buffer requirement, the proposal would amend\\nthe Board\\'s stress testing and capital plan rules to require banking organizations subject to\\nCategory I, II, or III standards to project their risk-based capital ratios in their company-run\\nstress tests and capital plans using the calculation approach that results in the binding ratios as of\\nthe start of the projection horizon (generally, as of December 31 of a given year). Also, the\\nproposal would require banking organizations subject to Category IV standards to project their\\nrisk-based capital ratios under baseline conditions in their capital plans and FR Y-14A\\nsubmissions using the risk-weighted assets calculation approach that results in the binding ratios\\nas of the start of the projection horizon. The use of the binding approach to calculating risk-based\\ncapital ratios aims to conform company-run stress tests and capital plans with the binding risk-\\nbased capital ratios in the proposed capital rule and promote simplicity relative to possible\\nalternatives (such as requiring that firms project ratios under both the expanded risk-based\\napproach and the standardized approach).\\nQuestion 7: The Board invites comment on the appropriate level of risk capture for the\\nrisk-weighted assets framework and the stress capital buffer requirement, both for their\\nPage 29 of 1089\\nrespective roles in the capital framework and for their joint determination of overall capital\\nrequirements. How should the Board balance considerations of overall capital requirements with\\nthe distinct roles of minimum requirements and buffer requirements? What adjustments, if any,\\nto either piece of the framework should the Board consider? Which, if any, specific portfolios or\\nexposure classes merit particular attention and why?\\nQuestion 8: What are the advantages and disadvantages of applying the same stress\\ncapital buffer requirement to a banking organization\\'s risk-based capital ratios regardless of\\nwhether they are determined using the standardized or expanded risk-based approach? What\\nwould be the advantages and disadvantages of applying different stress capital buffer\\nrequirements for each set of risk-based capital ratios?\\nQuestion 9: What, if any, adjustments should the Board consider with respect to the\\nbuffer requirements to account for the transitions in this proposal, particularly related to\\nexpanded total risk-weighted assets? For example, what would be the advantages and\\ndisadvantages of the Board determining stress capital buffer requirements using fully phased-in\\nexpanded total risk-weighted assets versus transitional expanded total risk-weighted assets?\\nWhat, if any, additional adjustments to stress capital buffer requirements should the Board\\nconsider during the expanded total risk-weighted assets transition?\\nB. Definition of capital\\nThe agencies regularly review their capital framework to help ensure it is functioning as\\nintended. Consistent with this ongoing assessment, the agencies believe it is appropriate to align\\nthe definition of capital for banking organizations subject to Category III or IV capital standards\\nwith the definition currently applicable to banking organizations subject to Category I or II\\ncapital standards. The current definition of capital applicable to banking organizations subject to\\nPage 30 of 1089\\nCategory I or II capital standards provides for risk sensitivity and transparency that is\\ncommensurate with the size, complexity, and risk profile of banking organizations subject to\\nCategory III or IV capital standards. The proposed alignment of the numerator and denominator\\nof regulatory capital ratios of large banking organizations would support the transparency of the\\ncapital rule as it facilitates market participants\\' assessment of loss absorbency and would\\npromote consistency of requirements across large banking organizations.\\nAs described in more detail below, under the proposal, banking organizations subject to\\nCategory III or IV capital standards would be required to recognize most elements of AOCI in\\nregulatory capital consistent with the treatment for banking organizations subject to Category I\\nor II capital standards. Banking organizations subject to Category III or IV capital standards\\nwould also apply the capital deductions and minority interest treatments that are currently\\napplicable to banking organizations subject to Category I or II capital standards. The proposal\\nwould also apply total loss absorbing capacity (TLAC) holdings deduction treatments to banking\\norganizations subject to Category III or IV capital standards. The proposal includes a three-year\\ntransition period for AOCI.\\n1. Accumulated other comprehensive income\\nUnder the current capital rule, banking organizations subject to Category I or II capital\\nstandards are required to include most elements of AOCI in regulatory capital; whereas all other\\nbanking organizations including those subject to Category III or IV capital standards were\\nprovided an opportunity to make a one-time election to opt-out of recognizing most elements of\\nAOCI and related deferred tax assets (DTAs) and deferred tax liabilities within regulatory capital\\nPage 31 of 1089\\n(AOCI opt-out banking organizations).\\xc2\\xb29 Under the proposal, consistent with the treatment\\napplicable to banking organizations subject to Category I or II capital standards, banking\\norganizations subject to Category III or IV capital standards would be required to include all\\nAOCI components in common equity tier 1 capital, except gains and losses on cash-flow hedges\\nwhere the hedged item is not recognized on a banking organization\\'s balance sheet at fair value.\\nThis would require all net unrealized holding gains and losses on available-for-sale (AFS) debt\\nsecurities30 from changes in fair value to flow through to common equity tier 1 capital, including\\nthose that result primarily from fluctuations in benchmark interest rates. This treatment would\\nbetter reflect the point in time loss-absorbing capacity of banking organizations subject to\\nCategory III or IV capital standards and would align with banking organizations subject to\\nCategory I or II capital standards.\\nThe agencies have previously observed that the requirement to recognize elements of\\nAOCI in regulatory capital has helped improve the transparency of regulatory capital ratios, as it\\nbetter reflects banking organizations\\' actual loss-absorbing capacity at a specific point in time,\\n29\\nSee 12 CFR 3.22(b) (OCC); 12 CFR 217.22(b) (Board); 12 CFR 324.22(b) (FDIC). A banking\\norganization that made an opt-out election is currently required to adjust common equity tier 1\\ncapital as follows: subtract any net unrealized holding gains and add any net unrealized holding\\nlosses on available-for-sale securities; subtract any accumulated net gains and add any\\naccumulated net losses on cash flow hedges; subtract any amounts recorded in AOCI attributed\\nto defined benefit postretirement plans resulting from the initial and subsequent application of\\nthe relevant GAAP standards that pertain to such plans (excluding, at the banking organization\\'s\\noption, the portion relating to pension assets deducted under section 22(a)(5) of the current\\ncapital rule); and, subtract any net unrealized holding gains and add any net unrealized holding\\nlosses on held-to-maturity securities that are included in AOCI.\\n30 AFS securities refers to debt securities. ASC Subtopic 321-10 eliminated the classification of\\nequity securities with readily determinable fair values not held for trading as available-for-sale\\nand generally requires investments in equity securities to be measured at fair value with changes\\nin fair value recognized in net income. Changes in the fair value of (i.e., the unrealized gains and\\nlosses on) a banking organization\\'s equity securities are recognized through net income rather\\nthan other comprehensive income.\\nPage 32 of 1089\\nnotwithstanding the potential volatility that such recognition may pose for their regulatory capital\\nratios. The agencies have also previously observed that AOCI is an important indicator used by\\nmarket participants to evaluate the capital strength of a banking organization.\\xc2\\xb3\\xc2\\xb9 More recently,\\nthe agencies have observed generally higher levels of securities classified as held-to-maturity\\n(HTM) among banking organizations that recognize AOCI in regulatory capital.\\xc2\\xb32\\n34\\nChanges in interest rates have led to net unrealized losses for banking organizations\\'\\ninvestment portfolios and brought into focus the importance of regulatory capital measures\\nreflecting the loss absorbing capacity of a banking organization. The agencies have observed that\\nadverse trends in a banking organization\\'s GAAP equity can have negative market perception\\nand liquidity implications.33 Specifically, net unrealized losses on AFS securities included in\\nAOCI have reduced banking organizations\\' tangible book value and liquidity buffers,\\xc2\\xb34 which\\ncan adversely affect market participants\\' assessments of capital adequacy and liquidity. Banking\\norganizations are often reluctant to sell these AFS securities as the unrealized losses would\\nbecome realized losses upon sale, thus reducing regulatory capital. However, banking\\norganizations may need to take such steps in order to meet liquidity needs. Recognizing elements\\nof AOCI in regulatory capital thus achieves a better alignment of regulatory capital with market\\nparticipants\\' assessment of loss-absorbing capacity.\\n31\\n84 Federal Register 59230, 59249 (November 1, 2019)).\\n32 GAAP set forth restrictions on the classification of a debt security as HTM, circumstances not\\nconsistent with the HTM classification, and situations that call into question or taint a banking\\norganization\\'s intent to hold securities in the HTM category.\\n33\\nSee Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Supervision and Regulation Report, at\\n11 (November 2022); Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, Semiannual Risk Perspective,\\nat 22 (Fall 2022); Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Fourth Quarter 2022 Quarterly\\nBanking Profile, at 5, 22 (February 2023), Managing Sensitivity to Market Risk in a Challenging\\nInterest Rate Environment (FIL\\xe2\\x80\\x9346\\xe2\\x80\\x932013, October 8, 2013).\\n34\\nSee 12 CFR 50 (OCC); 12 CFR 249 (Board); 12 CFR 329 (FDIC).\\nPage 33 of 1089\\nQuestion 10: What complementary measures should the banking agencies consider\\nregarding the regulatory capital treatment for securities held as HTM rather than AFS?\\n2. Regulatory capital deductions\\nThe agencies have long limited the amount of intangible and higher-risk assets, such as\\nmortgage servicing assets (MSAs) and certain temporary difference DTAs, included in\\nregulatory capital and required deduction of the amounts above the limits. This is due to the\\nrelatively high level of uncertainty regarding the ability of banking organizations to both\\naccurately value and realize value from these assets, especially under adverse financial\\nconditions. The current capital rule also limits the amount of investments in the capital\\ninstruments of other banking organizations that can be reflected in regulatory capital.\\nFurthermore, the current capital rule limits the inclusion of minority interest\\xc2\\xb35 in regulatory\\ncapital in recognition that minority interest is generally not available to absorb losses at the\\nbanking organization\\'s consolidated level and to prevent highly capitalized subsidiaries from\\noverstating the amount of capital available to absorb losses at the consolidated organization.\\nUnder the current capital rule, banking organizations subject to Category I or II capital\\nstandards must deduct from common equity tier 1 capital amounts of MSAs, temporary\\ndifference DTAs that the banking organization could not realize through net operating loss\\ncarrybacks, and significant investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions in\\nthe form of common stock\\xc2\\xb36 (collectively, threshold items) that individually exceed 10 percent of\\n35\\nMinority interest, also referred to as non-controlling interest, reflects investments in the\\ncapital instruments of subsidiaries of banking organizations that are held by third parties.\\n36\\nA significant investment in the capital of an unconsolidated financial institution is defined as\\nan investment in the capital of an unconsolidated financial institution where a banking\\norganization subject to Category I or II capital standards owns more than 10 percent of the issued\\nPage 34 of 1089\\nthe banking organization\\'s common equity tier 1 capital minus certain deductions and\\nadjustments. \\xc2\\xb37 Banking organizations subject to Category I or II capital standards must also\\ndeduct from common equity tier 1 capital the aggregate amount of threshold items not deducted\\nunder the 10 percent threshold deduction but that nevertheless exceeds 15 percent of the banking\\norganization\\'s common equity tier 1 capital minus certain deductions and adjustments. Under the\\ncurrent capital rule, banking organizations subject to Category III or IV capital standards are\\nrequired to deduct from common equity tier 1 capital any amount of MSAs, temporary difference\\nDTAs that the banking organization could not realize through net operating loss carrybacks, and\\ninvestments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions\\xc2\\xb38 that individually exceed 25\\npercent of common equity tier 1 capital of the banking organization minus certain deductions and\\nadjustments.\\nUnder the proposal, banking organizations subject to Category III or IV capital standards\\nwould be required to deduct threshold items from common equity tier 1 capital and apply other\\ncapital deductions that are currently applicable to banking organizations subject to Category I or\\nII capital standards instead of the deductions applicable to all other banking organizations,\\nthereby creating alignment across all banking organizations subject to the proposal.\\nand outstanding common stock of the unconsolidated financial institution. 12 CFR 3.2 (OCC);\\n12 CFR 217.2 (Board); 12 CFR 324.2 (FDIC).\\n37 See 12 CFR 3.22(c)(6), (d)(2) (OCC); 12 CFR 217.22(c)(6), (d)(2) (Board); 12 CFR\\n324.22(c)(6), (d)(2) (FDIC).\\n38 For banking organizations that are not subject to Category I or II capital standards, the current\\ncapital rule does not have distinct treatments for significant and nonsignificant investments in the\\ncapital of unconsolidated financial institutions. Rather, the regulatory capital treatment for an\\ninvestment in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions would be based on the type of\\ninstrument underlying the investment.\\nPage 35 of 1089\\nIn addition to deductions for the threshold items, the current capital rule requires that a\\nbanking organization subject to Category I or II capital standards deduct from regulatory capital\\nany amount of the banking organization\\'s nonsignificant investments\\xc2\\xb3\\xe2\\x81\\xb9 in the capital of\\nunconsolidated financial institutions that exceeds 10 percent of the banking organization\\'s\\ncommon equity tier 1 capital minus certain deductions and adjustments.40 Further, significant\\ninvestments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions not in the form of common\\nstock must be deducted from regulatory capital in their entirety.4\\xc2\\xb9 Under the proposal, banking\\norganizations subject to Category III or IV capital standards would be required to make these\\ndeductions.\\n42\\nSimilar to the deductions for investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial\\ninstitutions, the current capital rule requires banking organizations subject to Category I or II\\ncapital standards to deduct covered debt instruments from regulatory capital.4\\xc2\\xb2 Under the\\nproposal, banking organizations subject to Category III or IV capital standards would be required\\nto apply the deduction requirements for certain investments in unsecured debt instruments issued\\nby U.S. or foreign GSIBs (covered debt instruments) that currently apply to banking\\norganizations subject to Category I or II capital standards.4\\xc2\\xb3 The current capital rule generally\\n43\\n39\\nA non-significant investment in the capital of an unconsolidated financial institution is defined\\nas an investment in the capital of an unconsolidated financial institution where a banking\\norganization subject to Category I or II capital standards owns 10 percent or less of the issued\\nand outstanding common stock of the unconsolidated financial institution. 12 CFR 3.2 (OCC);\\n12 CFR 217.2 (Board); 12 CFR 324.2 (FDIC).\\n40 12 CFR 3.22(c)(5) (OCC); 12 CFR 217.22(c)(5) (Board); 12 CFR 324.22(c)(5) (FDIC).\\n4\\xc2\\xb9 12 CFR 3.22(c)(6) (OCC); 12 CFR 217.22(c)(6) (Board); 12 CFR 324.22(c)(6) (FDIC).\\n42\\nSee 12 CFR 3.22(c) (OCC); 12 CFR 217.22(c) (Board); 12 CFR 324.22(c) (FDIC).\\n43 Similar to banking organizations subject to Category II capital standards, the definition of\\nexcluded covered debt and the applicable capital treatment, would not apply to banking\\nPage 36 of 1089\\ntreats investments in unsecured debt instruments issued by U.S. or foreign GSIBs as tier 2 capital\\ninstruments for purposes of applying deduction requirements.\\nThe current capital rule also limits the amount of minority interest that banking\\norganizations subject to Category I or II capital standards may include in regulatory capital based\\non the amount of capital held by a consolidated subsidiary, relative to the amount of capital the\\nsubsidiary would have had to maintain to avoid any restrictions on capital distributions and\\ndiscretionary bonus payments under capital conservation buffer requirements.44 Under the\\ncurrent capital rule, banking organizations subject to Category III or IV capital standards are\\nallowed to include: (i) common equity tier 1 minority interest comprising up to 10 percent of the\\nparent banking organization\\'s common equity tier 1 capital; (ii) tier 1 minority interest\\ncomprising up to 10 percent of the parent banking organization\\'s tier 1 capital; and (iii) total\\ncapital minority interest comprising up to 10 percent of the parent banking organization\\'s total\\ncapital.45 Under the proposal, the limitations on minority interests that apply to banking\\norganizations subject to Category I or II capital standards would also apply to banking\\norganizations subject to Category III or IV capital standards.\\n3. Additional definition of capital adjustments\\nThe current capital rule applies an additional capital eligibility criterion to banking\\norganizations subject to Category I or II capital standards for their additional tier 1 and tier 2\\ncapital instruments.

Changes to the definition of tier 2 capital applicable to large banking\\norganizations\\nThe current capital rule defines an element of tier 2 capital to include the allowance for\\nloan and lease losses (ALLL) or the adjusted allowance for credit losses (AACL), as applicable,\\nup to 1.25 percent of standardized total risk-weighted assets not including any amount of the\\nALLL or AACL, as applicable (and excluding in the case of a banking organization subject to\\nmarket risk requirements, its standardized market risk-weighted assets). Further, as part of its\\ncalculations for determining its total capital ratio, a banking organization subject to Category I or\\nII standards must determine its advanced-approaches-adjusted total capital by (1) deducting from\\nits total capital any ALLL or AACL, as applicable, included in its tier 2 capital and; (2) adding to\\nits total capital any eligible credit reserves that exceed the banking organization\\'s total expected\\ncredit losses to the extent that the excess reserve amount does not exceed 0.6 percent of credit-\\nrisk-weighted assets. Due to changes in GAAP, all large banking organizations are no longer\\nusing ALLL and must use AACL. In addition, the concept of eligible credit reserves is related to\\nuse of the internal ratings-based approach, which the proposal would eliminate. Therefore, under\\nPage 38 of 1089\\nthe proposal, a large banking organization would determine its expanded risk-based approach-\\nadjusted total capital by (1) deducting from its total capital AACL included in its tier 2 capital\\nand; (2) adding to its total capital any AACL up to 1.25 percent of total credit risk-weighted\\nassets. The proposal would define total credit risk-weighted assets as the sum of total risk-\\nweighted assets for: (1) general credit risk as calculated under \\xc2\\xa7__.110; (2) cleared transactions\\nand default fund contributions as calculated under \\xc2\\xa7____.114; (3) unsettled transactions as\\ncalculated under \\xc2\\xa7___.115; and (4) securitization exposures as calculated under \\xc2\\xa7___.132.\\nQuestion 11: The agencies seek comment on the proposed definition of total credit risk-\\nweighted assets in connection with determining a banking organization\\'s total capital ratio.\\nWhat, if any, modifications should the agencies consider making to this definition and why?\\nC. Credit risk\\nCredit risk arises from the possibility that an obligor, including a borrower or\\ncounterparty, will fail to perform on an obligation. While loans are a significant source of credit\\nrisk, other products, activities, and services also expose banking organizations to credit risk,\\nincluding investments in debt securities and other credit instruments, credit derivatives, and cash\\nmanagement services. Off-balance sheet activities, such as letters of credit, unfunded loan\\ncommitments, and the undrawn portion of lines of credit, also expose banking organizations to\\ncredit risk.\\nIn this section of the Supplementary Information, subsection III.C.1. describes\\nexpectations for completing due diligence on a banking organization\\'s credit risk portfolio;\\nsubsection III.C.2. describes the risk-weight treatment for on-balance sheet exposures under the\\nproposal; subsection III.C.3. describes the proposed approach to determine the exposure amount\\nfor off-balance sheet exposures; and subsections III.C.4.-5 provide the available approaches for\\nPage 39 of 1089\\nrecognizing the benefits of credit risk mitigants including certain guarantees, certain credit\\nderivatives and financial collateral.\\n1. Due diligence\\nBanking organizations must maintain capital commensurate with the level and nature of\\nthe risks to which they are exposed.46 The agencies\\' safety and soundness guidelines establish\\nstandards for banking organizations to have an adequate understanding of the impact of their\\nlending decisions on the banking organization\\'s credit risk.47 A banking organization\\'s\\nperformance of due diligence on their credit portfolios is central to meeting both of these\\nobligations. For example, under the safety and soundness guidelines, a banking organization is\\nexpected to have established effective internal policies, processes, systems, and controls to\\nensure that the banking organization\\'s regulatory reporting is accurate and reflects appropriate\\nrisk weights assigned to credit exposures.\\nWhen properly performed, due diligence may lead a banking organization to conclude\\nthat the minimum regulatory capital requirements for certain exposures do not sufficiently\\naccount for their potential credit risk. In such instances, the banking organization should take\\nappropriate risk mitigating measures such as allocating additional capital, establishing larger\\ncredit loss allowances, or requiring additional collateral. Adherence to due diligence standards,\\nas established through the agencies\\' safety and soundness guidelines, directly supports and\\n48\\n46\\nSee 12 CFR 3.10(e) (OCC); 12 CFR 217.10(e) (Board); 12 CFR 324.10(e) (FDIC).\\n47 See 12 CFR part 30, Appendix A (OCC); 12 CFR Appendix D-1 to part 208 (Board); 12 CFR\\nAppendix A to part 364 (FDIC).\\n48 When performing due diligence, banking organizations must adhere to the operational and\\nmanagerial standards for loan documentation and credit underwriting as set forth in the\\nInteragency Guidelines Establishing Standards for Safety and Soundness (safety and soundness\\nguidelines).\\nPage 40 of 1089\\nfacilitates requirements for banking organizations to maintain capital commensurate with the\\nlevel and nature of the risks to which they are exposed.\\nQuestion 12: The agencies seek comment on whether due diligence requirements should\\nbe directly integrated into the text of the final rule. What would be the advantages and\\ndisadvantages of specifying increases in risk weights that would be required to the extent that\\ndue diligence requirements are not met, similar to the proposed risk-weight treatment for\\nsecuritization exposures as described in section III.D of this Supplementary Information?\\n2. Proposed risk weights for credit risk\\nThe proposal would replace the use of internal models to set regulatory capital\\nrequirements for credit risk as set out in subpart E of the current capital rule with a new\\nexpanded risk-based approach for credit risk applicable to large banking organizations. The\\nproposed expanded risk-based approach for credit risk would retain many of the same definitions\\n\\xc2\\xa7__.2 of the current capital rule including among others a sovereign, a sovereign exposure,\\ncertain supranational entities, a multilateral development bank, a public sector entity (PSE), a\\ngovernment-sponsored enterprise (GSE), other assets, and a commitment. Some elements of the\\nproposed expanded risk-based approach for credit risk would apply the same risk-weight\\ntreatment provided in subpart D of the current capital rule (current standardized approach) for\\non-balance sheet exposures, including exposures to sovereigns, certain supranational entities and\\nmultilateral development banks, government sponsored entities (GSEs) in the form of senior debt\\nand guaranteed exposures, Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) and Federal Agricultural Mortgage\\nCorporation (Farmer Mac) equity exposures,49 public sector entities (PSEs), and other assets.\\n49\\nFor treatment of other exposures to GSEs, see discussion related to equity exposures in section\\nIII.E. and exposures to subordinated debt instruments in section III.C.2.d. of this Supplementary\\nInformation.\\nPage 41 of 1089\\nThe proposal would also apply the same risk-weight treatment provided in the current\\nstandardized approach to the following real estate exposures: pre-sold construction loans,\\nstatutory multifamily mortgages, and high-volatility commercial real estate (HVCRE) exposures.\\nRelative to the internal models-based approaches in the advanced approaches under the\\ncurrent capital rule, the proposed expanded risk-based approach would result in more transparent\\ncapital requirements for credit risk exposures across banking organizations. The proposal would\\nalso facilitate comparisons of capital adequacy across banking organizations by reducing\\nexcessive, unwarranted variability in risk-weighted assets for similar exposures. Relative to the\\ncurrent standardized approach, the proposal would incorporate more granular risk factors to\\nallow for a broader range of risk weights.\\nSpecifically, the proposal would introduce the expanded risk-based approach for\\nexposures to depository institutions, foreign banks, and credit unions; exposures to subordinated\\ndebt instruments, including those to GSEs; and real estate, retail, and corporate exposures. The\\nproposal would also increase risk capture for certain off-balance sheet exposures through a new\\nexposure methodology for commitments without pre-set limits and would modify the credit\\nconversion factors applicable to commitments. Additionally, the proposal would introduce new\\ndefinitions for defaulted exposures and defaulted real estate exposures.\\nUnder the proposal, a banking organization would determine the risk-weighted asset\\namount for an on-balance sheet exposure by multiplying the exposure amount by the applicable\\nrisk weight, consistent with the method used under the current standardized approach. The on-\\nbalance sheet exposure amount would generally be the banking organization\\'s carrying value50\\n50\\nCarrying value under \\xc2\\xa7____. 2 of the current capital rule means, with respect to an asset, the\\nvalue of the asset on the balance sheet of the banking organization as determined in accordance\\nPage 42 of 1089\\nof the exposure, consistent with the value of the asset on the balance sheet as determined in\\naccordance with GAAP, which is the same as under the current capital rule. For all assets other\\nthan AFS securities and purchased credit-deteriorated assets, the carrying value is not reduced by\\nany associated credit loss allowance that is determined in accordance with GAAP. Using the\\nvalue of an asset under GAAP to determine a banking organization\\'s exposure amount would\\nreduce burden and provide a consistent framework that can be easily applied across all banking\\norganizations of the proposal because, in most cases, GAAP serve as the basis for the\\ninformation presented in financial statements and regulatory reports.\\nThe proposal would group credit risk exposures into the following categories: sovereign\\nexposures; exposures to certain supranational entities and multilateral development banks;\\nexposures to GSEs; exposures to depository institutions, foreign banks, and credit unions;\\nexposures to PSEs; real estate exposures; retail exposures; corporate exposures; defaulted\\nexposures; exposures to subordinated debt instruments; and off-balance sheet exposures.\\nThe proposed categories with amended risk-weight treatments relative to the current\\nstandardized approach include equity exposures to GSEs and exposures to subordinated debt\\ninstruments issued by GSEs; exposures to depository institutions, foreign banks, and credit\\nunions; exposures to subordinated debt instruments; real estate exposures; retail exposures;\\ncorporate exposures; defaulted exposures; and some off-balance sheet exposures such as\\n51\\nwith GAAP. For all assets other than available-for-sale debt securities or purchased credit\\ndeteriorated assets, the carrying value is not reduced by any associated credit loss allowance that\\nis determined in accordance with GAAP. See 12 CFR 3.2 (OCC); 12 CFR 217.2 (Board); 12\\nCFR 324.2 (FDIC). The exposure amount arising from an OTC derivative contract; a repo-style\\ntransaction or an eligible margin loan; a cleared transaction; a default fund contribution; or a\\nsecuritization exposure would be calculated in accordance with \\xc2\\xa7\\xc2\\xa7___. 113, 121, or 131 of the\\nproposal, respectively, as described in sections III.C.4, II.C.5.b., and III.D. of this Supplementary\\nInformation.\\n51\\nSee 12 U.S.C. \\xc2\\xa7 1831n.\\nPage 43 of 1089\\ncommitments. The proposed risk weight treatments for each of these categories are described in\\nthe following sections of this Supplementary Information.\\na. Defaulted exposures\\nThe proposal would introduce an enhanced definition of a defaulted exposure that would\\nbe broader than the current capital rule\\'s definition of a defaulted exposure under subpart E. The\\nproposed scope and criteria of the defaulted exposure category is intended to appropriately\\ncapture the elevated credit risk of exposures where the banking organization\\'s reasonable\\nexpectation of repayment has been reduced, including exposures where the obligor is in default\\non an unrelated obligation. Under the proposal, a defaulted exposure would be any exposure that\\nis a credit obligation and that meets the proposed criteria related to reduced expectation of\\nrepayment, and that is not an exposure to a sovereign entity,5\\xc2\\xb2 a real estate exposure,\\xc2\\xb3\\xc2\\xb3 or a policy\\nloan.54 The proposal would define a credit obligation as any exposure where the lender but not\\nthe obligor is exposed to credit risk. In other words, for these exposures, the lender would have a\\nclaim on the obligor that does not give rise to counterparty credit risk55 and would exclude\\n52\\n53\\n52 Under the proposal, the expanded risk-based approach would rely on the treatment of\\nsovereign default in the current standardized approach in the capital rule. See 12 CFR 3.32(a)(6)\\n(OCC); 12 CFR 217.32(a)(6) (Board); 12 CFR 324.32 (a)(6) (FDIC).\\n53 For the treatment of defaulted real estate exposures, see section III.C.2.e.vii of this\\nSupplementary Information.\\n54 A policy loan is defined under \\xc2\\xa7___.2 of the current capital rule to mean means a loan by an\\ninsurance company to a policy holder pursuant to the provisions of an insurance contract that is\\nsecured by the cash surrender value or collateral assignment of the related policy or contract. A\\npolicy loan includes: (1) A cash loan, including a loan resulting from early payment benefits or\\naccelerated payment benefits, on an insurance contract when the terms of contract specify that\\nthe payment is a policy loan secured by the policy; and (2) An automatic premium loan, which is\\na loan that is made in accordance with policy provisions which provide that delinquent premium\\npayments are automatically paid from the cash value at the end of the established grace period\\nfor premium payments. See 12 CFR 3.2 (OCC); 12 CFR 217.2 (Board); 12 CFR 324.2 (FDIC).\\n55 Counterparty credit risk is the risk that the counterparty to a transaction could default before\\nthe final settlement of the transaction where there is a bilateral risk of loss.\\nPage 44 of 1089\\nderivative contracts, cleared transactions, default fund contributions, repo-style transactions,\\neligible margin loans, equity exposures, and securitization exposures.\\nFor all other exposure categories (excluding an exposure to a sovereign entity, real estate\\nexposure, a retail exposure, or a policy loan), the proposed definition of defaulted exposure\\nwould look to the performance of the borrower with respect to credit obligations to any creditor.\\nSpecifically, if the banking organization determines that an obligor meets any of the of the\\ndefaulted criteria for exposures that are not retail exposures, described further below, the\\nproposal would require the banking organization to treat all exposures that are credit obligations\\nof that obligor as defaulted exposures. Additionally, the proposal would differentiate the criteria\\nfor determining whether an exposure is a defaulted exposure between exposures that are retail\\nexposures and those that are not.\\nRetail exposures are originated to individuals or small- and medium-sized businesses.\\nEvaluating whether a retail borrower has other exposures that are in default as defined by the\\nproposal may be difficult to operationalize for banking organizations given many unique\\nobligors. For other types of exposures that are not retail exposures, evaluating default at the\\nobligor level is appropriate because those obligors are more likely to have additional credit\\nobligations that are large and held by multiple banking organizations. Default on one of those\\ncredit obligations would be indicative of increased riskiness of the exposure held by a banking\\norganization, and hence a banking organization should account for this in evaluating the risk\\nprofile of the borrower.\\nUnder the proposal, for a retail exposure, a credit obligation would be considered a\\ndefaulted exposure if any of the following has occurred: (1) the exposure is 90 days past due or\\nin nonaccrual status; (2) the banking organization has taken a partial charge-off, write-down of\\nPage 45 of 1089\\nprincipal, or negative fair value adjustment on the exposure for credit-related reasons, until the\\nbanking organization has reasonable assurance of repayment and performance for all contractual\\nprincipal and interest payments on the exposure; or (3) a distressed restructuring of the exposure\\nwas agreed to by the banking organization, until the banking organization has reasonable\\nassurance of repayment and performance for all contractual principal and interest payments on\\nthe exposure as demonstrated by a sustained period of repayment performance, provided that a\\ndistressed restructuring includes the following made for credit-related reasons: forgiveness or\\npostponement of principal, interest, or fees, term extension, or an interest rate reduction. A\\nsustained period of repayment performance by the borrower is generally a minimum of six\\nmonths in accordance with the contractual terms of the restructured exposure.\\nFor exposures that are not retail exposures (excluding an exposure to a sovereign entity, a\\nreal estate exposure, or a policy loan), a credit obligation would be considered a defaulted\\nexposure if either of the following has occurred: (1) the obligor has a credit obligation to the\\nbanking organization that is 90 days or more past due56 or in nonaccrual status; or (2) the\\nbanking organization determines that, based on ongoing credit monitoring, the obligor is unlikely\\nto pay its credit obligations to the banking organization in full, without recourse by the banking\\norganization. If a banking organization determines that an obligor meets these proposed criteria,\\nthe proposal would require the banking organization to treat all exposures that are credit\\nobligations of that obligor as defaulted exposures.\\nFor purposes of the second criterion, the proposal would require a banking organization\\nto consider an obligor as unlikely to pay its credit obligations if any of the following criteria\\n56 Overdrafts are past due and are considered defaulted exposures once the obligor has breached\\nan advised limit or been advised of a limit smaller than the current outstanding balance.\\nPage 46 of 1089\\napply: (1) the obligor has any credit obligation that is 90 days or more past due or in nonaccrual\\nstatus with any creditor; (2) any credit obligation of the obligor has been sold at a credit-related\\nloss; (3) a distressed restructuring of any credit obligation of the obligor was agreed to by any\\ncreditor, provided that a distressed restructuring includes the following made for credit-related\\nreasons: forgiveness or postponement of principal, interest, or fees, term extension or an interest\\nrate reduction; (4) the obligor is subject to a pending or active bankruptcy proceeding; or (5) any\\ncreditor has taken a full or partial charge-off, write-down of principal, or negative fair value\\nadjustment on a credit obligation of the obligor for credit-related reasons. Under the proposal,\\nbanking organizations are expected to conduct ongoing credit monitoring regarding relevant\\nobligors. The proposal would require banking organizations to continue to treat an exposure as a\\ndefaulted exposure until the exposure no longer meets the definition or until the banking\\norganization determines that the obligor meets the definition of investment grade57 or the\\nproposed definition of speculative grade.58 The proposal would revise the definition of\\nspeculative grade, consistent with the current definition of investment grade, to allow the\\ndefinition to apply to entities to which the banking organization is exposed through a loan or\\nsecurity. In addition, the proposal would make the same revision to the definition of sub-\\nspeculative grade.\\n57 Under \\xc2\\xa7___.2 of the current capital rule, investment grade means that the entity to which the\\nbanking organization is exposed through a loan or security, or the reference entity with respect to\\na credit derivative, has adequate capacity to meet financial commitments for the projected life of\\nthe asset or exposure. Such an entity or reference entity has adequate capacity to meet financial\\ncommitments if the risk of its default is low and the full and timely repayment of principal and\\ninterest is expected. See 12 CFR 3.2 (OCC); 12 CFR 217.2 (Board); 12 CFR 324.2 (FDIC).\\n58 The proposal would revise the definition of speculative grade to mean that the entity to which\\na banking organization is exposed through a loan or security, or the reference entity with respect\\nto a credit derivative, has adequate capacity to meet financial commitments in the near term, but\\nis vulnerable to adverse economic conditions, such that should economic conditions deteriorate,\\nthe issuer or the reference entity would present an elevated default risk.\\nPage 47 of 1089\\nA banking organization would assign a 150 percent risk weight to a defaulted exposure\\nincluding any exposure amount remaining on the balance sheet following a charge-off, and any\\nother non-retail exposure to the same obligor, to reflect the increased uncertainty as to the\\nrecovery of the remaining carrying value. The proposed risk weight is intended to reflect the\\nimpaired credit quality of defaulted exposures and to help ensure that banking organizations\\nmaintain sufficient regulatory capital for the increased probability of losses on these exposures.\\nA banking organization may apply a risk weight to the guaranteed or secured portion of a\\ndefaulted exposure based on (1) the risk weight under section \\xc2\\xa7___.120 of the proposal if the\\nguarantee or credit derivative meets the applicable requirements or (2) the risk weight under\\nsection \\xc2\\xa7.121 of the proposal if the collateral meets the applicable requirements.\\nQuestion 13: How does the defaulted exposure definition compare with banking\\norganizations\\' existing policies relating to the determination of the credit risk of a defaulted\\nexposure and the creditworthiness of a defaulted obligor? What additional clarifications are\\nnecessary to determine the point at which retail and non-retail exposures should no longer be\\ntreated as defaulted exposures?\\nQuestion 14: What operational challenges, if any, would a banking organization face in\\nidentifying which exposures meet the proposed definition of defaulted exposure? In particular,\\nthe agencies seek comment on the ability of a banking organization to obtain the necessary\\ninformation to assess whether the credit obligations of a borrower to creditors other than the\\nbanking organization would meet the proposed criteria? What operational challenges, if any,\\nwould a banking organization face in identifying whether obligors on non-retail credit\\nobligations are subject to a pending or active bankruptcy proceeding?\\nPage 48 of 1089\\nQuestion 15: For the purposes of retail credit obligations, the agencies invite comment\\non the appropriateness of including a borrower\\'s bankruptcy as a criterion for a defaulted\\nexposure. What operational challenges, if any, would a banking organization face in identifying\\nwhether obligors on retail credit obligations are subject to a pending or active bankruptcy\\nproceeding? To what extent would criteria (1) through (3) in the proposed defaulted exposure\\ndefinition for retail exposures sufficiently capture the risk of a borrower involved in a\\nbankruptcy proceeding?\\nQuestion 16: What alternatives to the proposed treatment should the agencies consider\\nwhile maintaining a risk-sensitive treatment for credit risk of a defaulted borrower? For\\nexample, what would be the advantages and disadvantages of limiting the defaulted borrower\\nscope to obligations of the borrower with the banking organization?\\nb. Exposures to government-sponsored enterprises\\nThe proposal would assign a 20 percent risk weight to GSE59 exposures that are not\\nequity exposures, securitization exposures or exposures to a subordinated debt instrument issued\\nby a GSE, consistent with the current standardized approach.60 Under the proposal, an exposure\\nto the common stock issued by a GSE would be an equity exposure. An exposure to the preferred\\nstock issued by a GSE would be an equity exposure or an exposure to a subordinated debt\\n59 Government-sponsored enterprise (GSE) under \\xc2\\xa7__. 2 of the current capital rule means an\\nentity established or chartered by the U.S. government to serve public purposes specified by the\\nU.S. Congress but whose debt obligations are not explicitly guaranteed by the full faith and\\ncredit of the U.S. government. See 12 CFR 3.2 (OCC); 12 CFR 217.2 (Board); 12 CFR 324.2\\n(FDIC).\\n60 Similar to the treatment of senior debt exposures to GSEs and GSE exposures that are not\\nequity exposures or exposures to a subordinated debt instrument issued by a GSE, the proposal\\nwould apply the same 20 percent risk weight to all exposures to FHLB or Farmer Mac, including\\nequity exposures and exposures to subordinated debt instruments, which continues the treatment\\nunder the current standardized approach.\\nPage 49 of 1089\\ninstrument, depending on the contractual terms of the preferred stock instrument. Equity\\nexposures to a GSE must be assigned a risk-weighted asset amount as calculated under sections\\n____.140 through ____.142 of subpart E. An exposure to a subordinated debt instrument issued by a\\nGSE must be assigned a 150 percent risk weight, unless issued by a FHLB or Farmer Mac. As\\ndiscussed later in sections III.E. and III.C.2.d. of this Supplementary Information, equity\\nexposures and exposures to subordinated debt instruments would generally be subject to an\\nincreased risk-based capital requirement to reflect their heightened risk relative to exposures to\\nsenior debt.\\nc. Exposures to depository institutions, foreign banks, and credit unions\\nThe proposal would define the scope of exposures to depository institutions, foreign\\nbanks, and credit unions in a manner that is consistent with the definitions and scope of\\nexposures covered under the current capital rule. Under the proposal, a bank exposure would\\nmean an exposure (such as a receivable, guarantee, letter of credit, loan, OTC derivative\\ncontract, or senior debt instrument) to any depository institution, foreign bank, or credit union.61\\nThe proposed treatment for bank exposures supports the simplicity, transparency, and\\nconsistency objectives of the proposal in a manner that is appropriately risk sensitive. The\\nproposal would provide three categories for bank exposures that are ranked from the highest to\\nthe lowest in terms of creditworthiness: Grade A, Grade B, and Grade C. The assignment of the\\n61\\nUnder \\xc2\\xa7__.2 of the current capital rule, a depository institution means a depository institution\\nas defined in section 3 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, a foreign bank means a foreign\\nbank as defined in section 211.2 of the Federal Reserve Board\\'s Regulation K (12 CFR 211.2)\\n(other than a depository institution), and a credit union means an insured credit union as defined\\nunder the Federal Credit Union Act (12 U.S.C. \\xc2\\xa7 1751 et seq.). See 12 CFR 3.2 (OCC); 12 CFR\\n217.2 (Board); 12 CFR 324.2 (FDIC). Exposures to other financial institutions, such as bank\\nholding companies, savings and loans holding companies, and securities firms, generally would\\nbe considered corporate exposures. See 78 FR 62087 (October 11, 2013).\\nPage 50 of 1089\\nbank exposure category would be based on the obligor depository institution, foreign bank, or\\ncredit union. As outlined below, the proposal would rely on the current capital rule\\'s definition\\nof investment grade and the proposed definition of speculative grade for differentiating the credit\\nrisk of bank exposures. In addition, the proposal would incorporate publicly disclosed capital\\nlevels to differentiate the financial strength of a depository institution, foreign bank, or credit\\nunion in a manner that is both objective and transparent to supervisors and the public.\\nMore specifically, a Grade A bank exposure would mean a bank exposure for which the\\nobligor depository institution, foreign bank, or credit union (1) is investment grade, and (2)\\nwhose most recent publicly disclosed capital ratios meet or exceed the higher of: (a) the\\nminimum capital requirements and any additional amounts necessary to not be subject to\\nlimitations on distributions and discretionary bonus payments under the capital rules established\\nby the prudential supervisor of the depository institution, foreign bank, or credit union, and (b) if\\napplicable, the capital ratio requirements for the well-capitalized category under the agencies\\'\\nprompt corrective action framework,62 or under similar rules of the National Credit Union\\nAdministration. For example, an exposure to an investment grade depository institution could\\nqualify as a Grade A bank exposure if the depository institution was not subject to limitations on\\ndistributions and discretionary bonus payments under the capital rules and had risk-based capital\\nratios that met the well capitalized thresholds under the agencies\\' prompt corrective action\\nframework. Further, a bank exposure to a depository institution that had opted into the\\ncommunity bank leverage ratio (CBLR) framework and is investment grade would be considered\\n63\\n62\\nThe capital ratios used for this determination are the ratios on the depository institution\\'s most\\nrecent quarterly Consolidated Report of Condition and Income (Call Report).\\n63\\nSee 12 CFR part 702 (National Credit Union Administration).\\nPage 51 of 1089\\nto be a Grade A bank exposure, even if the obligor depository institution were in the grace period\\nunder the CBLR framework.64 Under the proposal, a depository institution that uses the CBLR\\nframework would not be required to calculate or disclose risk-based capital ratios for purposes of\\nqualifying as a Grade A bank exposure.\\nA Grade B bank exposure would mean a bank exposure that is not a Grade A bank\\nexposure and for which the obligor depository institution, foreign bank, or credit union (1) is\\nspeculative grade or investment grade, and (2) whose most recent publicly disclosed capital\\nratios meet or exceed the higher of: (a) the applicable minimum capital requirements under\\ncapital rules established by the prudential supervisor of the depository institution, foreign bank,\\nor credit union, and (b) if applicable, the capital ratio requirements for the adequately-capitalized\\ncategory65 under the agencies\\' prompt corrective action framework,66 or under similar rules of\\nthe National Credit Union Administration.\"\\nFor a foreign bank to qualify as a Grade A or Grade B bank exposure, the proposal would\\nrequire the applicable capital standards imposed by the home country supervisor to be consistent\\nwith international capital standards issued by the Basel Committee.\\nA Grade C bank exposure would mean a bank exposure that does not qualify as a Grade\\nA or Grade B bank exposure. For example, a bank exposure would be a Grade C bank exposure\\nif the obligor depository institution, foreign bank, or credit union has not publicly disclosed its\\ncapital ratios within the last six months. In addition, an exposure would be a Grade C bank\\n64\\nSee 12 CFR 3.12(a)(1) (OCC); 12 CFR 217.12(a)(1) (Board); 12 CFR 324.12(a)(1) (FDIC).\\n65 See 12 CFR 6.4(b)(2) (OCC); 12 CFR 208.43(b)(2) (Board); 12 CFR 324.403(b)(2) (FDIC).\\n66 The capital ratios used for this determination are the ratios on the depository institution\\'s most\\nrecent quarterly Call Report.\\n67 See 12 CFR part 702 (National Credit Union Administration).\\nPage 52 of 1089\\nexposure if the external auditor of the depository institution, foreign bank, or credit union has\\nissued an adverse audit opinion or has expressed substantial doubt about the ability of the\\ndepository institution, foreign bank, or credit union to continue as a going concern within the\\nprevious 12 months.\\nUnder the proposal, a foreign bank exposure that is a Grade A or Grade B bank exposure\\nand is a self-liquidating, trade-related contingent item that arises from the movement of goods\\nand that has a maturity of three months or less may be assigned a risk weight that is lower than\\nthe risk weight applicable to other exposures to the same foreign bank. The proposed approach to\\nproviding a preferential risk weight for short-term self-liquidating, trade-related contingent items\\nwould be consistent with the current standardized approach.\\nThe proposal would also address the risk that capital and foreign exchange controls\\nimposed by a sovereign entity in which a foreign bank is located could prevent or materially\\nimpede the ability of the foreign bank to convert its currency to meet its obligations or transfer\\nfunds. The proposal would, therefore, provide a risk weight floor for foreign bank exposures\\nbased on the risk weight applicable to a sovereign exposure for the jurisdiction where the foreign\\nbank is incorporated when (1) the exposure is not in the local currency of the jurisdiction where\\nthe foreign bank is incorporated; or (2) the exposure to a foreign bank branch that is not in the\\nlocal currency of the jurisdiction in which the foreign branch operates (sovereign risk-weight\\nfloor).68 The risk weight floor would not apply to short-term self-liquidating, trade-related\\ncontingent items that arise from the movement of goods.\\n68\\nSee \\xc2\\xa7.111 for the proposed sovereign risk-weight table, which is identical to Table 1 to\\n\\xc2\\xa7.32 in the current capital rule.\\nPage 53 of 1089\\nAs provided in Table 2, the proposed risk weights for bank exposures generally would\\nrange from 40 percent to 150 percent.\\nTable 2\\nBase risk weight\\nRisk weight for a foreign\\nbank exposure that is a\\nself-liquidating, trade-\\nrelated contingent item\\nthat arises from the\\nmovement of goods and\\nthat has a maturity of\\nthree months or less\\nProposed Risk Weights for Bank Exposures\\nGrade A Bank\\nExposure\\n40%\\n20%\\nGrade B Bank\\nExposure\\n75%\\n50%\\nGrade C Bank\\nExposure\\n150%\\n150%\\nQuestion 17: What are the advantages and disadvantages of assigning a range of risk\\nweights based on the bank\\'s creditworthiness?

Subordinated debt instruments\\nThe proposal would introduce a definition and an explicit risk weight treatment for\\nexposures in the form of subordinated debt instruments. The proposed definition of a\\nsubordinated debt instrument would capture exposures that are financial instruments and present\\nheightened credit risk but are not equity exposures, including: (1) any preferred stock that does\\nnot meet the definition of an equity exposure, (2) any covered debt instrument, including a\\nTLAC debt instrument, that is not deducted from regulatory capital, and (3) any debt instrument\\nthat qualifies as tier 2 capital under the current capital rule or that would otherwise be treated as\\nregulatory capital by the primary federal supervisor of the issuer and that is not deducted from\\nregulatory capital.\\nThe proposal would define a subordinated debt instrument as (1) a debt security that is a\\ncorporate exposure, a bank exposure, or an exposure to a GSE, including a note, bond,\\n69 Under \\xc2\\xa7___. 2 of the current capital rule, a Country Risk Classification (CRC) for a sovereign\\nmeans the most recent consensus CRC published by the Organization for Economic Cooperation\\nand Development (OECD) as of December 31st of the prior calendar year that provides a view of\\nthe likelihood that the sovereign will service its external debt.

The CRC methodology\\nclassifies countries into one of eight risk categories (0\\xe2\\x80\\x937), with countries assigned to the zero\\ncategory having the lowest possible risk assessment and countries assigned to the 7 category\\nhaving the highest possible risk assessment. See 78 FR 62088.\\nPage 55 of 1089\\ndebenture, similar instrument, or other debt instrument as determined by the primary federal\\nsupervisor, that is subordinated by its terms, or separate intercreditor agreement, to any creditor\\nof the obligor, or (2) preferred stock that is not an equity exposure. For these purposes, a debt\\nsecurity would be subordinated if the documentation creating or evidencing such indebtedness\\n(or a separate intercreditor agreement) provides for any of the issuer\\'s other creditors to rank\\nsenior to the payment of such indebtedness in the event the issuer becomes the subject of a\\nbankruptcy or other insolvency proceeding, with the scope of applicable bankruptcy or other\\ninsolvency proceedings being defined in the applicable documentation. The scope of the\\ndefinition of a subordinated debt instrument is meant to capture the types of entities that issue\\nsubordinated debt instruments and for which the level of subordination is a meaningful\\ndeterminant of the credit risk of the instrument.\\nIn addition, even though the provision of collateral typically reduces the risk of loss on\\nindebtedness, the proposal includes secured as well as unsecured subordinated debt securities in\\nthe scope of subordinated debt instruments, since the effect of subordination may result in the\\ncollateral providing little or no real value to the subordinated debt holder in the event the issuer\\nbecomes to subject of a bankruptcy or other insolvency proceeding. A subordinated debt\\ninstrument would not include any loan, including a syndicated loan, a debt security issued by a\\nsovereign, public sector entity, multilateral development bank, or supranational entity, or a\\nsecurity that would be captured under the securitization framework. Due to the contractual\\nobligations and structures associated with subordinated debt instruments, such exposures\\ngenerally pose increased risk relative to a senior loan, including a syndicated loan, or a senior\\ndebt security to the same entity because investments in subordinated debt instruments are usually\\nPage 56 of 1089\\nconsidered junior creditors and subordinate to obligations specified in the definition of senior\\ndebt in the document governing the junior creditors\\' obligations.\\nThe proposal generally would apply a 150 percent risk weight for exposures that meet the\\ndefinition of a subordinated debt instrument, including any preferred stock that is not an equity\\nexposure, and any tier 2 instrument or covered debt instrument that is not deducted from\\nregulatory capital, including TLAC debt instruments, and any debt instrument that would\\notherwise be treated as regulatory capital by the primary federal supervisor of the issuer and that\\nis not deducted from regulatory capital.71\\nThe instruments included in the scope of subordinated debt instruments present a greater\\nrisk of loss to an investing banking organization relative to more senior debt exposures to the\\nsame issuer because subordinated debt instruments have a lower priority of repayment in the\\nevent of default. As a result, the proposal would apply an increased risk weight to recognize this\\nincrease in loss given default. Since a covered debt instrument that qualifies as a TLAC debt\\ninstrument shares similar risk characteristics with a subordinated debt instrument, the proposal\\nwould require banking organizations to apply the same 150 percent risk weight to any such\\nexposures that are not otherwise deducted from regulatory capital.\\nQuestion 20: The agencies seek comment on the scope of the proposed definition of a\\nsubordinated debt instrument. What, if any, operational challenges might the proposed definition\\n71 Covered debt instruments are subject to deduction by banking organizations subject to\\nCategory I or II capital standards similar to the deduction framework for exposures to capital\\ninstruments.

Under the proposal, the\\nrisk weight treatment for statutory real estate exposures that are not defaulted real estate\\nexposures would be consistent with the current standardized approach.\\nThe proposal would differentiate the credit risk of real estate exposures that are not\\nstatutory real estate exposures by introducing the following categories: regulatory residential real\\nestate exposures, regulatory commercial real estate exposures, ADC exposures, and other real\\nestate exposures.

Under the proposal, regulatory residential\\nand regulatory commercial real estate exposures would be required to meet prudential criteria\\nthat are intended to reduce the likelihood of default relative to other real estate exposures. The\\ncriteria in these definitions generally align with existing Interagency Guidelines for Real Estate\\nLending Policies (real estate lending guidelines).76 Real estate loans in which repayment is\\ndependent on the cash flows generated by the real estate can expose a banking organization to\\nelevated credit risk relative to comparable exposures77 as the borrower may be unable to meet its\\nfinancial commitments when cash flows from the property decrease, such as when tenants\\ndefault or properties are unexpectedly vacant. In addition, LTV ratios can be a useful risk\\nindicator because the amount of a borrower\\'s equity in a real estate property correlates inversely\\nwith default risk and provides banking organizations with a degree of protection against losses.7\\xe2\\x81\\xb9\\nTherefore, exposures with lower LTV ratios generally would receive a lower risk weight than\\ncomparable real estate exposures with higher LTV ratios under the proposal.80 The following\\nchart illustrates how the proposal would require a banking organization to assign risk weights to\\nvarious real estate exposures, as described in more detail below:\\n78\\n76\\nSee 12 CFR part 34, Appendix A to subpart D (OCC); 12 CFR part 208, Appendix C (Board);\\n12 CFR part 365, Appendix A (FDIC).\\n77 Comparable exposures include loans secured by real estate where the repayment of the loan\\ndepends on non-real estate cash flows such as owner-occupied properties, revenue from\\nmanufacturing or retail sales.\\n78\\nSee Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Financial Stability Report (November\\n2020), https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/files/financial-stability-report-20201109.pdf\\nId., at 30.\\n79\\n80 The proposed LTV criterion measures the borrower\\'s use of debt (leverage) to finance a real\\nestate purchase, with higher LTV reflecting greater leverage and thus higher credit risk.\\nPage 60 of 1089\\nYes\\nIs this a residential\\nmortgage exposure not\\ndependent on cash\\nflows?\\ni.\\nYes, apply 100% risk\\nweight\\nNo, apply 150% risk\\nweight\\nIs this a defaulted real\\nestate exposure?\\nYes\\nIs this a statutory real\\nestate exposure?\\nHigh volatility\\ncommercial real estate\\n(HVCRE) exposure,\\napply 150% risk weight\\nStatutory multifamily\\nexposure, apply 50%\\nrisk weight\\nNo\\nPresold construction\\nloan, apply (i) 50% risk\\nweight or (ii) 100% risk\\nweight if purchase\\ncontract is cancelled\\nIs this an acquisition,\\ndevelopment, or construction\\n(ADC) exposure?\\nYes, apply 100% risk\\nweight to ADC exposures\\nthat are not HVCRE\\nExposure qualifies as\\nregulatory residential\\nreal estate\\nIs the exposure\\ndependent on the cash\\nflows generated by the\\nreal estate?\\nYes\\nNo, apply 40% to 90%\\nrisk weights, based on\\nLTV\\nSee table 5 to \\xc2\\xa7.111\\nRegulatory residential real estate exposures\\nNo\\nYes, apply 50% to 125%\\nrisk weights, based on\\nLTV\\nSee table 6 to \\xc2\\xa7_.111\\nNo\\nIs this a regulatory\\nresidential or\\ncommercial real estate\\nexposure?\\nExposure qualifies as\\nregulatory commercial\\nreal estate\\nIs the exposure\\ndependent on the cash\\nflows generated by the\\nreal esatate?\\nYes, apply 70% to 110%\\nrisk weights, based on\\nLTV\\nSee table 8 to \\xc2\\xa7__.111\\nNo, apply risk weight\\napplicable to borrower\\nor 60%, based on LTV\\nSee table 7 to \\xc2\\xa7__.111\\nNo\\nExposure is \"other\" real\\nestate\\nIs the exposure a\\nresidential mortgage\\nexposure that is not\\ndependent on the cash\\nflows generated by the\\nreal estate?\\nYes, apply 100% risk\\nweight\\nNo, apply 150% risk\\nweight\\nPage 61 of 1089\\n81\\nUnder the proposal, a regulatory residential real estate exposure would be defined as a\\nfirst-lien residential mortgage exposure (as defined in \\xc2\\xa7____.2) that is not a defaulted real estate\\nexposure (as defined in \\xc2\\xa7____. 101), an ADC exposure, a pre-sold construction loan, a statutory\\nmultifamily mortgage, or an HVCRE exposure, provided the exposure meets certain prudential\\ncriteria.\\xc2\\xb3\\xc2\\xb9 First, the loan would be required to be secured by a property that is either owner-\\noccupied or rented.

Regulatory commercial real estate exposures\\nThe proposal would define a regulatory commercial real estate exposure as a real estate\\nexposure that is not a regulatory residential real estate exposure, a defaulted real estate exposure,\\n81 Consistent with the standardized approach in the capital rule, under the proposal, when a\\nbanking organization holds the first-lien and junior-lien(s) residential mortgage exposures and no\\nother party holds an intervening lien, the banking organization must combine the exposures and\\ntreat them as a single first-lien regulatory residential real estate exposure, if the first-lien meets\\nall of the criteria for a regulatory residential real estate exposure.\\n82 For more information on value of the property, see section III.C.2.e.iv of this Supplementary\\nInformation.\\n83\\nSee 12 CFR part 30, Appendix A (OCC); 12 CFR part 208, Appendix C (Board); 12 CFR parts\\n364 and 365 (FDIC).\\nPage 62 of 1089\\nan ADC exposure, a pre-sold construction loan, a statutory multifamily mortgage, or an HVCRE\\nexposure, provided the exposure meets several prudential criteria.

Fourth, during the underwriting process, the banking organization must apply\\nunderwriting policies that account for the ability of the borrower to repay in a timely manner\\nbased on clear and measurable underwriting standards that enable the banking organization to\\nevaluate these credit factors. The agencies would expect that these underwriting standards would\\nbe consistent with the agencies\\' safety and soundness and real estate lending guidelines. Finally,\\nthe property must be valued in accordance with the proposed requirements included in the\\nproposed LTV ratio calculation, as discussed below.\\nQuestion 23: The agencies seek comment on the application of prudent underwriting\\nstandards in the proposed definitions of regulatory residential and regulatory commercial real\\nestate exposures, including standards relating to the loan amount as a percent of the value of the\\nproperty. What, if any, further clarity is needed and why?\\n111. Exposures that are dependent on the cash flows generated by the real estate\\nAs noted above, the proposal would differentiate the risk weight of regulatory residential,\\nregulatory commercial, and other real estate exposures based on whether the borrower\\'s ability\\n84 When the banking organization also holds a junior security interest in the same property and\\nno other party holds an intervening security interest, the banking organization must treat the\\nexposures as a single first-lien regulatory commercial real estate exposure, if the first-lien meets\\nall of the criteria for a regulatory commercial real estate exposure.\\nPage 63 of 1089\\nto service the loan is dependent on cash flows generated by the real estate. Exposures that are\\ndependent on the cash flows generated by real estate to repay the loan can be affected by local\\nmarket conditions and present elevated credit risk relative to exposures that are serviceable by\\nthe income, cash, or other assets of the borrower. For example, an increase in the supply of\\ncompetitive rental property can lower demand and suppress cash flows needed to support\\nrepayment of the loan.\\nIf the underwriting process at origination of the real estate exposure considers any cash\\nflows generated by the real estate securing the loan, such as from lease or rental payments or\\nfrom the sale of the real estate as a source of repayment, then the exposure would meet the\\nproposal\\'s definition of dependent on the cash flows generated by the real estate. Evaluating\\nwhether repayment of the exposure is dependent on cash flows generated from the real estate is a\\nconservative and straightforward approach for differentiating the credit risk of real estate\\nexposures. Given their increased credit risk, the proposal would assign relatively higher risk\\nweights to exposures that are dependent on any proceeds or income generated from the real\\nestate itself to service the debt.\\nUnder the proposal, additional loan characteristics can affect whether an exposure would\\nbe considered dependent on cash flows from the real estate. The proposal\\'s definition of\\ndependence on the cash flows generated by the real estate would exclude any residential\\nmortgage exposure that is secured by the borrower\\'s principal residence as such mortgage\\nexposures present reduced credit risk relative to real estate exposures that are secured by the\\nborrower\\'s non-principal residence.85 For residential properties that are not the borrower\\'s\\n85\\nFor example, if (1) a borrower purchases a two-unit property with the intention of making one\\nunit their principal residence, (2) the borrower intends to rent out the second unit to a third party,\\nPage 64 of 1089\\nprincipal residence, including vacation homes and other second homes, such properties would be\\nconsidered dependent on the cash flows generated by the real estate unless the banking\\norganization has relied solely on the borrower\\'s personal income and resources, rather than rental\\nincome (or resale or refinance of the property), to repay the loan.\\nFor regulatory commercial real estate exposures, the applicable risk weights similarly\\nwould be determined based on whether repayment is dependent on the cash flows generated by\\nthe real estate. For example, the agencies would expect that rental office buildings, hotels, and\\nshopping centers leased to tenants are dependent on the cash flows generated by the real estate\\nfor repayment of the loan. In the case of a loan to a borrower to purchase or refinance real estate\\nwhere the borrower will operate a business such as a retail store or factory and rely solely on the\\nrevenues from the business or resources of the borrower other than rental, resale, or other income\\nfrom the real estate for repayment, the exposure would not be considered dependent on the cash\\nflows generated by the real estate under the proposal. Similarly, a loan to the owner-operator of a\\nfarm would not be considered dependent on the cash flows generated by the real estate under the\\nproposal if the borrower will rely solely on the sale of products from the farm or other resources\\nof the borrower other than rental, resale, or other income from the real estate for repayment.\\nQuestion 24: What, if any, alternative quantitative threshold should the agencies\\nconsider in determining whether a real estate exposure is dependent on cash flows from the real\\nestate (for example, a threshold between 5 and 50 percent of the income)? Further, if the\\nagencies decide to adopt an alternative quantitative threshold, either for regulatory residential\\nand (3) the banking organization considered the cash flows from the rental unit as a source of\\nrepayment, the exposure would not meet the proposal\\'s definition of dependent on the cash flows\\ngenerated by the real estate because the property securing the exposure is the borrower\\'s\\nprincipal residence.\\nPage 65 of 1089\\nor regulatory commercial real estate exposures, how should it be calibrated for regulatory\\nresidential and separately for regulatory commercial real estate exposures and what would be\\nthe appropriate calibration levels for each? Please provide specific examples of any alternatives,\\nincluding calculations and supporting data.\\nQuestion 25: The agencies seek feedback on the proposed treatment of exposures secured\\nby second homes, including vacation homes where repayment of the loan is not dependent on\\ncash flows. What are the advantages and disadvantages of treating such exposures as regulatory\\nresidential real estate exposures? Would a different category be more appropriate for these\\nexposures given their risk profile, and if so, describe which other category(s) of real estate\\nexposures would be most similar and why. Please provide supporting data in your responses.86\\nQuestion 26: The agencies seek comment on the treatment of residential mortgage\\nexposures where repayment is dependent on cash flows from overnight or short-term rentals, as\\nsuch cash flows may not be as reliable as a source of repayment as cash flows from long-term\\nrental contracts or the borrower\\'s other income sources. What would be the advantages or\\ndisadvantages of treating residential real estate exposures dependent on cash flows from short-\\nterm rentals similar to commercial real estate exposures dependent on cash flows?\\nCalculating the loan-to-value ratio\\nThe proposal would require a banking organization also to use LTV ratios to assign a risk\\nweight to a regulatory residential or regulatory commercial real estate exposure. Under the\\nproposal, LTV ratio would be calculated as the extension of credit divided by the value of the\\niv.\\n86 See Garcia, Daniel (2019). \"Second Home Buyers and the Housing Boom and Bust,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Finance\\nand Economics Discussion Series 2019-029. Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal\\nReserve System, https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/feds/files/2019029pap.pdf.\\nPage 66 of 1089\\nproperty. The proposed calculation of LTV ratio would be generally consistent with the real\\nestate lending guidelines except with respect to the recognition of private mortgage insurance, as\\ndescribed below.\\nThe extension of credit would mean the total outstanding amount of the loan including\\nany undrawn committed amount of the loan. The total outstanding amount of the loan would\\nreflect the current amortized balance as the loan pays down, which may allow a banking\\norganization to assign a lower risk weight during the life of the loan. Similarly, if a loan balance\\nincreases, a banking organization would need to increase the risk weight if the increased LTV\\nwould result in a higher risk weight. For purposes of the LTV ratio calculation, a banking\\norganization would calculate the loan amount without making any adjustments for credit loss\\nprovisions or private mortgage insurance. Not recognizing private mortgage insurance would be\\nconsistent with the current capital rule\\'s definition of eligible guarantor, which does not\\nrecognize an insurance company engaged predominately in the business of providing credit\\nprotection (such as a monoline bond insurer or re-insurer) and also reflects the performance of\\nprivate mortgage insurance during times of stress in the housing market. The agencies do not\\nintend the proposed risk weights to be applied to LTVs that include private mortgage insurance.\\nThe value of the property would mean the value at the time of origination of all real\\nestate properties securing or being improved by the extension of credit, plus the fair value of any\\nreadily marketable collateral and other acceptable collateral, as defined in the real estate lending\\nguidelines, that secures the extension of credit.\\nFor exposures subject to the Real Estate Lending, Appraisal Standards, and Minimum\\nRequirements for Appraisal Management Companies or Appraisal Standards for Federally\\nPage 67 of 1089\\nRelated Transactions (combined, the appraisal rule),87 the market value of real estate would be a\\nvaluation that meets all requirements of that rule. For exposures not subject to the appraisal rule,\\nthe proposal would require that (1) the market value of real estate be obtained from an\\nindependent valuation of the property using prudently conservative valuation criteria and (2) the\\nvaluation be done independently from the banking organization\\'s origination and underwriting\\nprocess. Most real estate exposures held by insured depository institutions are subject to the\\nagencies\\' appraisal rule, which also provides for evaluations in some cases, and provides for\\ncertain exceptions, such as where a lien on real estate is taken as an abundance of caution. To\\nhelp ensure that the value of the real estate is determined in a prudently conservative manner, the\\nproposal would also provide that, for exposures not subject to the appraisal rule, the valuations of\\nthe real estate properties would need to exclude expectations of price increases and be adjusted\\ndownward to take into account the potential for the current market prices to be significantly\\nabove the values that would be sustainable over the life of the loan.\\nIn addition, when the real estate exposure finances the purchase of the property, the value\\nwould be the lower of (1) the actual acquisition cost of the property and (2) the market value\\nobtained from either (i) the valuation requirements under the appraisal rule (if applicable) or (ii)\\nas described above, an independent valuation using prudently conservative valuation criteria that\\nis separate from the banking organization\\'s origination and underwriting process. Supervisory\\nexperience has shown that market values of real estate properties can be temporarily impacted by\\nlocal market forces and using a value figure including such volatility would not reflect the long-\\n87\\nSee 12 CFR part 34, subpart C or subpart G (OCC); 12 CFR part 208, subpart E or 12 CFR\\npart 225, subpart G (Board); 12 CFR part 323 (FDIC).\\nPage 68 of 1089\\nterm value of the real estate. Therefore, the proposal would require that the value used for the\\nLTV calculation be an amount that is more conservative than the market value of the property.\\nUsing the value of the property at origination when calculating the LTV ratio protects\\nagainst volatility risk or short-term market price inflation. For purposes of the LTV ratio\\ncalculation, the proposal would require banking organizations to use the value of the property at\\nthe time of origination, except under the following circumstances: (1) the banking organization\\'s\\nprimary federal supervisor requires the banking organization to revise the property value\\ndownward; (2) an extraordinary event occurs resulting in a permanent reduction of the property\\nvalue (for example, a natural disaster); or (3) modifications are made to the property that increase\\nits market value and are supported by an appraisal or independent evaluation using prudently\\nconservative criteria. These proposed exceptions are intended to constrain the use of values other\\nthan the value of the property at loan origination only to exceptional circumstances that are\\nsufficiently material to warrant use of a revised valuation.\\nFor purposes of determining the value of the property, the proposal would use the\\ndefinition of readily marketable collateral and other acceptable collateral consistent with the real\\nestate lending guidelines. Therefore, readily marketable collateral would mean insured deposits,\\nfinancial instruments, and bullion in which the banking organization has a perfected security\\ninterest. Financial instruments and bullion would need to be salable under ordinary\\ncircumstances with reasonable promptness at a fair market value determined by quotations based\\non actual transactions, on an auction or similarly available daily bid and ask price market.\\nReadily marketable collateral should be appropriately discounted by the banking organization\\nconsistent with the banking organization\\'s usual practices for making loans secured by such\\ncollateral. Other acceptable collateral would mean any collateral in which the banking\\nPage 69 of 1089\\norganization has a perfected security interest that has a quantifiable value and is accepted by the\\nbanking organization in accordance with safe and sound lending practices. Other acceptable\\ncollateral should be appropriately discounted by the banking organization consistent with the\\nbanking organization\\'s usual practices for making loans secured by such collateral. Under the\\nproposal, other acceptable collateral would include, among other items, unconditional\\nirrevocable standby letters of credit for the benefit of the banking organization. The\\nreasonableness of a banking organization\\'s underwriting criteria would be reviewed through the\\nexamination and supervisory process to help ensure its real estate lending policies are consistent\\nwith safe and sound banking practices.\\nQuestion 27: What are the benefits and drawbacks of allowing readily marketable\\ncollateral and other acceptable collateral to be included in the value for purposes of calculating\\nthe LTV ratio? What are the advantages and disadvantages of providing specific discount factors\\nto the value of acceptable collateral for purposes of calculating the LTV ratio such as the\\nstandard supervisory market price volatility haircuts contained in section 121 of the proposed\\nrule? What alternatives should the agencies consider?

For\\nexample, a banking organization may consider a borrower\\'s current and expected income, current\\nand expected cash flows, net worth, other relevant financial resources, current financial\\nobligations, employment status, credit history, or other relevant factors during the underwriting\\nprocess. The agencies are supportive of home ownership and do not intend the proposal to have\\n88\\nThe risk weight assigned to loans does not impact the appropriate treatment of loans under the\\nagencies\\' other regulations and guidance, such as the supervisory LTV limits under the real estate\\nlending guidelines.\\nPage 71 of 1089\\na disparate impact on home affordability or homeownership opportunities, including for low- and\\nmoderate-income (LMI) home buyers or other historically underserved markets. The agencies\\nare particularly interested in whether the proposed framework for regulatory residential real\\nestate exposures should be modified in any way to avoid unintended impacts on the ability of\\notherwise credit-worthy borrowers who make a smaller down payment to purchase a home. For\\nexample, the agencies are considering whether a 50 percent risk weight would be appropriate for\\nthese loans, to the extent they are originated in accordance with prudent underwriting standards\\nand originated through a home ownership program that the primary federal regulatory agency\\ndetermines provides a public benefit and includes risk mitigation features such as credit\\ncounseling and consideration of repayment ability.\\nQuestion 28: The agencies seek comment on how the proposed treatment of regulatory\\nresidential real estate exposures will impact home affordability and home ownership\\nopportunities, particularly for LMI borrowers or other historically underserved markets. What\\nare the advantages and disadvantages of an alternative treatment that would assign a 50 percent\\nrisk weight to mortgage loans originated in accordance with prudent underwriting standards\\nand originated through a home ownership program that the primary federal regulatory agency\\ndetermines provides a public benefit and includes risk mitigation features such as credit\\ncounseling and consideration of repayment ability? What, if any, additional or alternative risk\\nindicators should the agencies consider, besides loan-to-value or dependency upon cash flow for\\nrisk-weighting regulatory residential real estate exposures? Please provide specific examples of\\nmortgage lending programs where such factors were the basis for underwriting the loans and the\\nhistorical repayment performance of the loans in such programs. Please comment on whether\\nPage 72 of 1089\\nthese risk indicators are already collected and maintained by banking organizations as part of\\ntheir mortgage lending activities and underwriting practices.\\nIn addition, the agencies considered adopting an alternative risk-based capital treatment\\nin subpart E that does not rely on loan-to-value ratios or dependency upon cash flow generated\\nby the real estate. One such alternative would be to incorporate the same treatment for\\nresidential mortgage exposures as found in the current U.S. standardized risk-based capital\\nframework. Under this alternative, the risk-based capital treatment for residential mortgage\\nexposures in subpart D of the capital rule would be incorporated into the proposed subpart E.\\nFirst-lien residential mortgage exposures that are prudently underwritten would receive a 50\\npercent risk weight consistent with the treatment contained in the U.S. standardized risk-based\\ncapital framework. Such an approach would allow banking organizations to continue to offer\\nprudently underwritten products through lending programs with the flexibility to meet the needs\\nof their communities without additional regulatory capital implications. The agencies note that\\ncurrent mortgage rules promulgated since the global financial crisis require lenders to consider\\neach borrower\\'s ability to repay. 89\\nAs in subpart D, residential mortgage exposures that do not meet the requirements\\nnecessary to receive a 50 percent risk weight would receive a 100 percent risk weight. While\\nsuch an approach would not use loan-to-value or dependency upon cash flow generated by the\\nreal estate to assign a risk-weight, it would provide for a simpler framework where all prudently\\nunderwritten first-lien residential mortgage exposures would receive the same risk-based capital\\ntreatment. Lastly and consistent with the treatment in subpart D, if a banking organization holds\\nthe first and junior lien(s) on a regulatory residential real estate exposure and no other party\\n89 See 12 CFR 1026.\\nPage 73 of 1089\\nholds an intervening lien, the banking organization would be required to treat the combined\\nexposure as a single loan secured by a first lien for purposes of assigning a risk weight.\\nQuestion 29: The agencies seek comment on assigning risk weights to residential\\nmortgage exposures, consistent with the current U.S. standardized risk-based capital framework.\\nWhat are the pros and cons of this alternative treatment?\\nvi. Risk weights for regulatory commercial real estate exposures\\nIn a manner similar to regulatory residential real estate exposure, the proposal would\\nrequire a banking organization to assign a risk weight to a regulatory commercial real estate\\nexposure based on the exposure\\'s LTV ratio and whether the exposure is dependent on the cash\\nflows generated by the real estate, as reflected in Tables 7 and 8 below. For regulatory\\ncommercial real estate exposures that are not dependent on cash flows for repayment, the main\\ndriver of risk to the banking organization is whether the commercial borrower would generate\\nsufficient revenue through its non-real estate business activities to repay the loan to the banking\\norganization. For this reason, under Table 7 the proposed risk weight for the exposure would be\\ndependent on the risk weight assigned to the borrower. For the purposes of Table 7, if the LTV\\nratio of the exposures is greater than 60 percent, and the banking organization does not have\\nsufficient information about the exposure to determine what the risk weight applicable to the\\nborrower would be, the banking organization would be required to assign a 100 percent risk\\nweight to the exposure.\\nTable 7: Proposed risk weights for regulatory commercial real estate exposures that\\nare not dependent on the cash flows of the real estate\\nRisk weight\\nLTV ratio \\xe2\\x89\\xa4 60%\\nLesser of 60% risk weight\\nor the risk weight applicable\\nto the borrower\\nLTV ratio > 60%\\nRisk weight applicable to the\\nborrower\\nPage 74 of 1089\\nTable 8: Proposed risk weights for regulatory commercial real estate exposures that\\nare dependent on the cash flows of the real estate\\n60% LTV ratio \\xe2\\x89\\xa4 80%\\n90%\\nRisk weight\\nQuestion 30: What, if any, market effects could the proposed treatment have on\\nresidential and commercial real estate mortgage lending and why?

Defaulted real estate exposures\\nThe proposal would require banking organizations to apply an elevated risk weight to\\ndefaulted real estate exposures, consistent with the approach to defaulted exposures described in\\nsection III.C.2.a. of this Supplementary Information. The proposal would introduce a definition\\nof defaulted real estate exposure that would provide new criteria for determining whether a\\nresidential mortgage exposure or a non-residential mortgage exposure is in default. These new\\ncriteria are indicative of a credit-related default for such exposures. For residential mortgage\\nexposures, the definition of defaulted real estate exposure would require the banking\\norganization to evaluate default at the exposure level. For other real estate exposures that are not\\nresidential mortgage exposures, the definition of defaulted real estate exposure would require the\\nbanking organization to evaluate default at the obligor level, consistent with the approach\\ndescribe above for non-retail defaulted exposures.\\nSince residential mortgage exposures are primarily originated to individuals for the\\npurchase or refinancing of their primary residence, most obligors of residential real estate\\nexposures do not have additional real estate exposures. Therefore, determining default at the\\nexposure level would account for the material default risk of most residential mortgage\\nPage 75 of 1089\\nexposures. Additionally, evaluating defaulted residential mortgage exposures at the obligor level\\nmay be difficult for banking organizations to operationalize, for example, if there are challenges\\ncollecting information on the payment status of other obligations of individual borrowers.\\nIn contrast, for other types of real estate exposures, such as regulatory commercial real\\nestate and ADC exposures, evaluating default at the obligor level would be more appropriate and\\nless challenging as those obligors frequently have other credit obligations that are large in value\\nand potentially held by multiple banking organizations. Default by an obligor on other credit\\nobligations, which a banking organization should account for when evaluating the risk profile of\\nthe borrower, would indicate increased credit risk of the exposure held by a banking\\norganization.\\nA defaulted real estate exposure that is a residential mortgage exposure would include an\\nexposure (1) that is 90 days or more past due or in nonaccrual status; (2) where the banking\\norganization has taken a partial charge-off, write-down of principal, or negative fair value\\nadjustment on the exposure for credit-related reasons, until the banking organization has\\nreasonable assurance of repayment and performance for all contractual principal and interest\\npayments on the exposure; or (3) where the banking organization agreed to a distressed\\nrestructuring that includes the following credit-related reasons: forgiveness or postponement of\\nprincipal, interest, or fees; term extension; or an interest rate reduction. Distressed restructuring\\nwould not include a loan modified or restructured solely pursuant to the U.S. Treasury\\'s Home\\nAffordable Mortgage Program.\\n90\\n90\\nThe U.S. Treasury\\'s Home Affordable Mortgage Program was created under the Troubled\\nAsset Relief Program in response to the subprime mortgage crisis of 2008. See Emergency\\nEconomic Stabilization Act, Pub. L. 110-343, 122 Stat. 3765 (2008).\\nPage 76 of 1089\\nTo determine if a non-residential mortgage exposure would be a defaulted real estate\\nexposure, banking organizations would apply the same criteria as described above in section\\nIII.C.2.a. of this Supplementary Information that are used to determine if a non-retail exposure is\\na defaulted exposure. Banking organizations are expected to conduct ongoing credit reviews of\\nrelevant obligors. The proposal would require banking organizations to continue to treat non-\\nresidential real estate exposures that meet this definition as defaulted real estate exposures until\\nthe non-residential real estate exposure no longer meets the definition or until the banking\\norganization determines that the obligor meets the definition of investment grade or speculative\\ngrade.\\nUnder the proposal, a defaulted real estate exposure that is a residential mortgage\\nexposure not dependent on the cash flows generated by the real estate would receive a risk\\nweight of 100 percent, regardless of whether the exposure qualifies as a regulatory real estate\\nexposure, unless a portion of the real estate exposure is guaranteed under section \\xc2\\xa7__.120 of the\\nproposal. This treatment is consistent with the risk weight for past due residential mortgage\\nexposures under the current standardized approach. Additionally, a residential mortgage\\nguaranteed by the federal government through the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) or the\\nDepartment of Veterans Affairs (VA) generally will be risk-weighted at 20 percent under the\\nproposal, including a residential mortgage guaranteed by FHA or VA that meets the defaulted\\nreal estate exposure definition.\\nAny other defaulted real estate exposure would receive a risk weight of 150 percent,\\nincluding any other non-residential real estate exposure to the same obligor, consistent with the\\nproposed risk weight of other defaulted exposures described in section II.C.2.a. of this\\nSupplementary Information. A banking organization may apply a risk weight to the guaranteed\\nPage 77 of 1089\\nportion of defaulted real estate exposures based on the risk weight that applies under section\\n\\xc2\\xa7.120 of the proposal if the guarantee or credit derivative meets the applicable requirements.\\nQuestion 31: How does the defaulted real estate exposure definition compare with\\nbanking organizations\\' existing policies relating to the determination of the credit risk of\\ndefaulted real estate exposures and the creditworthiness of defaulted real estate obligors? What,\\nif any, additional clarifications are necessary to determine the point at which residential and\\nnon-residential mortgages should no longer be treated as defaulted exposures? Please provide\\nspecific examples and supporting data.\\nQuestion 32: For purposes of commercial real estate exposures, the agencies invite\\ncomment on the extent to which obligors have outstanding other exposures with multiple banking\\norganizations and other creditors. What would be the advantages and disadvantages of\\nconsidering both the obligor and the parent company or other entity or individual that owns or\\ncontrols the obligor when determining if the exposure meets the criteria for \"defaulted real\\nestate exposure\"?\\nQuestion 33: For purposes of residential mortgage exposures, the agencies invite\\ncomment on the appropriateness of including a borrower\\'s bankruptcy as a criterion for\\ndefaulted real estate exposure. Would criteria (1)(i) through (1)(iii) in the proposed defaulted\\nreal estate definition for residential mortgages sufficiently capture the risk of a borrower\\ninvolved in a bankruptcy proceeding?\\nviii. ADC exposures that are not HVCRE exposures\\nUnder the proposal, the agencies would define an ADC exposure as an exposure secured\\nby real estate for the purpose of acquiring, developing, or constructing residential or commercial\\nreal estate properties, as well as all land development loans, and all other land loans. Some ADC\\nPage 78 of 1089\\nexposures meet the definition of HVCRE exposure in \\xc2\\xa7___.2 of the capital rule and would be\\n91\\nassigned a 150 percent risk weight.\\xc2\\xba\\xc2\\xb9 Real estate exposures that meet the definition of ADC\\nexposure but do not meet the criteria of an HVCRE exposure or a defaulted real estate exposure\\nwould be assigned a 100 percent risk weight under the proposal. The proposed regulatory\\ntreatment for ADC exposures would not take into consideration cash flow dependency or LTV\\nratio criteria. ADC exposures are mostly short-term or bridge loans to cover construction or\\ndevelopment, or lease up or sales phases of a real estate project, rather than an amortizing\\npermanent loan for completed residential or commercial real estate. Supervisory experience has\\nshown that ADC exposures have heightened risk compared to permanent commercial real estate\\nexposures, and these exposures generally have been subject to a risk weight of 100 percent or\\nmore under the current standardized approach. Repayment of ADC loans is often based on the\\nexpected completion of the construction or development of the property, which can be delayed or\\ninterrupted by many factors such as changes in market condition or financial difficulty of the\\nobligor.\\nix. Other real estate exposures\\nThe proposal would define other real estate exposures as real estate exposures that are not\\ndefaulted real estate exposures, regulatory commercial real estate exposures, regulatory\\nresidential real estate exposures, ADC exposures, or any of the statutory real estate exposures.\\nAn exposure meeting the proposed definition of other real estate exposure poses\\nheightened credit risk as a result of not meeting the proposed prudential underwriting criteria\\n\\xe2\\x81\\xb91 Section 214 of the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act\\n(EGRRCPA) imposes certain requirements on high volatility commercial real estate acquisition,\\ndevelopment, or construction loans.

Specifically, the proposal\\nwould require a banking organization to assign a 150 percent risk weight to an other real estate\\nexposure, unless the exposure is a residential mortgage exposure that is not dependent on the\\ncash flows generated by the real estate, which must be assigned a 100 percent risk weight.\\nFor example, a banking organization would assign a 150 percent risk weight to real estate\\nexposures that are dependent on the cash flows generated by the underlying real estate, such as a\\nrental property, and that do not meet the regulatory residential or regulatory commercial real\\nestate exposure definitions. Loans for the purpose of acquiring real estate and reselling it at\\nhigher value that do not qualify as ADC loans and do not meet the definition of regulatory\\nresidential real estate exposures would be assigned a 150 percent risk weight as other real estate\\nexposures. The proposed 150 percent risk weight also would provide a regulatory capital\\nincentive for banking organizations to originate real estate exposures in accordance with the\\nprudential qualification requirements for regulatory residential and commercial real estate\\nexposures, respectively.\\nIn other cases, if a banking organization does not adequately evaluate the\\ncreditworthiness of a borrower for an owner-occupied residential mortgage exposure, or if the\\nborrower has inadequate creditworthiness or capacity to repay the loan, the exposure would not\\nbe considered prudently underwritten and would be assigned a 100 percent risk weight instead of\\nthe lower risk weights included in Table 5 for regulatory residential mortgage exposures not\\ndependent on the cash flows generated by the real estate. The 100 percent risk weight would also\\napply to junior lien home equity lines of credit and other second mortgages given the elevated\\nrisk of these loans when compared to similar senior lien loans.\\nPage 80 of 1089\\nf. Retail exposures\\nRelative to the current standardized approach, and as described in more detail below, the\\nproposal would increase the credit risk-sensitivity of the capital requirements applicable to retail\\nexposures by assigning risk weights that would vary depending on product type and the degree\\nof portfolio diversification. The proposal would introduce a new definition of retail exposure,\\nwhich would include an exposure to a natural person or persons, or an exposure to a small or\\nmedium-sized entity (SME)\\xe2\\x81\\xb9\\xc2\\xb2 that meets the proposed definition of a regulatory retail exposure\\ndescribed below. Including an exposure to an SME in the definition of a retail exposure provides\\na benefit for small companies, such as smaller limited liability companies, which may have\\ncharacteristics more similar to those of a natural person than of a larger corporation. The\\nproposed definition of a retail exposure would be narrower in scope than the current capital\\nrule\\'s existing definition of a retail exposure under subpart E, which includes a broader range of\\nexposures, including real estate-related exposures. Because the proposal would include separate\\nrisk-weight treatments for real estate exposures that account for the underlying collateral, the\\nproposed definition of a retail exposure would only apply to a retail exposure that would not\\notherwise be a real estate exposure.\\xe2\\x81\\xb9:\\n93\\n\\xe2\\x81\\xb92 An SME would mean an entity in which the reported annual revenues or sales for the\\nconsolidated group of which the entity is a part are less than or equal $50 million for the most\\nrecent fiscal year. This scope is generally consistent with the definition of an SME under the\\nBasel III reforms and also corresponds with the maximum receipts-based size standard for small\\nbusinesses set by the Small Business Administration, which varies by industry and does not\\nexceed $47 million per year. See 13 CFR part 121.\\n93 For an exposure that qualifies as a real estate exposure and also meets conditions (1) and (2) of\\nthe definition of a retail exposure, the proposal would require a banking organization to treat the\\nexposure as a real estate exposure and calculate risk-based requirements for the exposure as\\ndescribed in section III.C.2.e of this Supplementary Information.\\nPage 81 of 1089\\nThe proposal would differentiate the risk-weight treatment for retail exposures based on\\nwhether (1) the exposure qualifies as a regulatory retail exposure, (2) further qualifies as a\\ntransactor exposure; or (3) does not qualify for either of the previous categories and is treated as\\nan other retail exposure. The proposed definitions of a regulatory retail exposure and a transactor\\nexposure outlined below include key criteria for broadly categorizing the relative credit risk of\\nretail exposures.\\nTo qualify as a regulatory retail exposure, the proposal would require the exposure to be\\nin the form of any of the following credit products: a revolving credit or line of credit (such as a\\ncredit card, charge card, or overdraft) or a term loan or lease (such as an installment loan, auto\\nloan or lease, or student or educational loan) (collectively, eligible products). In addition, under\\nthe proposal, the amount of retail exposures that a banking organization could treat as regulatory\\nretail exposures would be limited on an aggregate and granular basis. A banking organization\\nwould include all outstanding and committed but unfunded regulatory retail exposures\\naccounting for any applicable credit conversion factor when aggregating the retail exposures.\\nSpecifically, the regulatory retail exposure category would exclude any retail exposure to a\\nsingle obligor and its affiliates that, in the aggregate with any other retail exposures to that\\nobligor or its affiliates, including both on- and off-balance sheet exposures, exceeds a combined\\ntotal of $1 million (aggregate limit).\\nIn addition, for any single retail exposure, only the portion up to 0.2 percent of the\\nbanking organization\\'s total retail exposures that are eligible products (granularity limit) would\\nbe considered a regulatory retail exposure. The portion of any single retail exposure that exceeds\\nthe granularity limit would not qualify as a regulatory retail exposure. For purposes of\\ncalculating the 0.2 percent granularity limit for a regulatory retail exposure, off-balance sheet\\nPage 82 of 1089\\nexposures would be subject to the applicable credit conversion factors, as discussed in\\n\\xc2\\xa7___.112(b), and defaulted exposures, as discussed in \\xc2\\xa7___.101(b) of the proposal, would be\\nexcluded. Under the proposal, if an exposure to an SME does not meet criteria (1) through (3) of\\nthe definition of a regulatory retail exposure, then none of the exposures to that SME would\\nqualify as retail exposures and all of the exposures to that SME would be treated as corporate\\nexposures.\\nThe proposal would define a transactor exposure as a regulatory retail exposure that is a\\ncredit facility where the balance has been repaid in full at each scheduled repayment date for the\\nprevious twelve months or an overdraft facility where there has been no drawdown over the\\nprevious twelve months. If a single obligor had both a credit facility and an overdraft facility\\nfrom the same banking organization, the banking organization would separately evaluate each\\nfacility to determine whether each facility would meet the definition of a transactor exposure to\\nbe categorized as a transactor exposure.\\nUnder the proposal, a banking organization would assign a risk weight of 55 percent to a\\nregulatory retail exposure that is a transactor exposure and an 85 percent risk weight to a\\nregulatory retail exposure that is not a transactor exposure. All other retail exposures would be\\nassigned a 110 percent risk weight. The proposed 55 percent risk weight for a transactor\\nexposure is appropriate because obligors that demonstrate a historical repayment capacity\\ngenerally exhibit less credit risk relative to other retail obligors. A regulatory retail exposure that\\nis not a transactor exposure warrants the proposed 85 percent risk weight, which would be lower\\nthan the proposed 110 percent risk weight for all other retail exposures, due to mitigating factors\\nrelated to size or concentration risk. The aggregate limit and granularity limit are intended to\\nensure that the regulatory retail portfolio consists of a set of small exposures to a diversified\\nPage 83 of 1089\\ngroup of obligors, which would reduce credit risk to the banking organization. Conversely,\\nbanking organizations with a high aggregate amount of retail exposures to a single obligor, or\\nexposures exceeding the granularity limit, have a heightened concentration of retail exposures.\\nThis concentration of retail exposures increases the level of credit risk the banking organization\\nhas to a single obligor, and the likelihood that the banking organization could face material\\nlosses if the obligor misses a payment or defaults. Therefore, any retail exposure that would not\\nqualify as a regulatory retail or a transactor exposure warrants a risk weight of 110 percent.\\nThe following example describes how a banking organization would identify the amount\\nof retail exposures that could be treated as regulatory retail exposures. First, a banking\\norganization would identify the amount of credit exposures that meet the eligible products\\ncriterion within the definition of a regulatory retail exposure. Assume a banking organization has\\n$100 million in total retail exposures that meet the eligible regulatory retail product criterion\\ndescribed above. Next, for this set of exposures, the banking organization would identify any\\namounts to a single obligor and its affiliates that exceed $1 million. The banking organization in\\nthis example determines that a single obligor and its affiliates account for an aggregate of $20\\nmillion of the banking organization\\'s total retail exposures. Because this $20 million exceeds the\\n$1 million threshold for amounts to a single obligor and its affiliates, this $20 million would be\\nretail exposures that are not regulatory retail exposures and subject to a 110 percent risk weight,\\nleaving $80 million that could be categorized as regulatory retail exposures.\\nAlso, assume that of the $80 million, $1 million of the exposures are considered defaulted\\nexposures. This $1 million in defaulted exposures would be subtracted from the $80 million. The\\nbanking organization would multiply the remaining $79 million by the 0.2 percent granularity\\nlimit, with the resulting $158,000 representing the dollar amount equivalent of the granularity\\nPage 84 of 1089\\nlimit for this banking organization\\'s retail portfolio. Therefore, of the remaining $79 million, the\\nportion of those retail exposures to a single obligor and its affiliates that do not exceed $158,000\\nwould be considered regulatory retail exposures. Of the regulatory retail exposures, the portion\\nof the exposure that would qualify as a transactor exposure would receive a 55 percent risk\\nweight and the remaining portion would receive an 85 percent risk weight. Under the proposal, a\\nbanking organization would assign a 110 percent risk weight to the portion of a retail exposure\\nthat exceeds the granularity limit. Thus, the total amount of retail exposures to a single obligor\\nexceeding $158,000 in this example would receive a 110 percent risk weight as other retail\\nexposures. This example is also illustrated in the following decision tree.\\n1. Identify any credit exposures that meet the\\neligible products criterion within the definition\\nof a regulatory retail exposure.\\n2. Identify any amounts to a single borrower\\nand its affiliates that exceed $1 million.\\n3. Exclude defaulted exposures from the\\nregulatory retail exposures\\n4.

What alternative thresholds or calibrations should the agencies consider for\\npurposes of retail exposures? Please provide supporting data in your response.\\nQuestion 35: What simplifications, if any, to the calculation described above for a\\nregulatory retail exposure should the agencies consider to reduce operational complexity for\\nbanking organizations? For example, what operational challenges would arise from assigning\\ndiffering risk weights to portions of retail exposures based on the regulatory retail eligibility\\ncriteria?\\nQuestion 36: Is the requirement for repayment of a credit facility in full at each\\nscheduled repayment date for the previous twelve months or lack of overdraft history an\\nappropriate criterion to distinguish the credit risk of a transactor exposure from other retail\\nexposures, and if not, what would be more appropriate and why? Is twelve months of full\\nrepayment history a sufficient amount of time to demonstrate a consistent repayment history of\\nthe credit or overdraft facility to meet the definition of a transactor and if not, what would be an\\nappropriate amount of time?\\ng. Risk-weight multiplier for certain retail and residential mortgage exposures with\\ncurrency mismatch\\nThe proposal would introduce a new requirement for banking organizations to apply a\\nmultiplier to the applicable risk weight assigned to certain exposures that contain currency\\nmismatches between the banking organization\\'s lending currency and the borrower\\'s source of\\nrepayment. The multiplier would reflect the borrower\\'s increased risk of default due to the\\nborrower\\'s exposure to foreign exchange risk. The multiplier would apply to exposure types\\nwhere the borrower generally does not manage or hedge its foreign exchange risk. Exposures\\nPage 86 of 1089\\nwith such currency mismatches pose increased credit risk to the banking organization as the\\nborrower\\'s repayment ability could be affected by exchange rate fluctuations.\\nTo capture this increased risk, the proposal would require banking organizations to apply\\na 1.5 multiplier to the applicable risk weight, subject to a maximum risk weight of 150 percent,\\nfor retail and residential mortgage exposures to a borrower that does not have a source of\\nrepayment in the currency of the loan equal to at least 90 percent of the annual payment from\\neither income generated through ordinary business activities or from a contract with a financial\\ninstitution that provides funds denominated in the currency of the loan, such as a forward\\nexchange contract. Other types of exposures generally account for foreign exchange risk through\\nhedging or other risk mitigants and would not be subject to the proposed multiplier. The\\nproposed risk weight ceiling of 150 percent aligns with the maximum risk weight for credit\\nexposures under the proposal.\\nQuestion 37: What, if any, additional or alternative criteria of the proposed multiplier\\nshould the agencies consider and why?\\nh. Corporate exposures\\nA corporate exposure under the proposal would be an exposure to a company that does\\nnot fall under any other exposure category under the proposal. This scope would be consistent\\nwith the definition found in \\xc2\\xa7__.2 of the current capital rule. For example, an exposure to a\\ncorporation that also meets the proposed definition of a real estate exposure would be a real\\nestate exposure rather than a corporate exposure for purposes of the proposal.\\nAs described in more detail below, the proposal would differentiate the risk weights of\\ncorporate exposures based on credit risk by considering such factors as a corporate exposure\\'s\\ninvestment quality and the general creditworthiness of the borrower, level of subordination, as\\nPage 87 of 1089\\nwell as the nature and substance of the lending arrangement, and the degree of reliance on the\\nborrower\\'s independent capacity for repayment of the obligation, or reliance on the income that\\nthe borrowing entity is expected to generate from the asset(s) or a project being financed. First, a\\nbanking organization would assign a 65 percent risk weight to a corporate exposure that is an\\nexposure to a company that is investment grade, and that has a publicly traded security\\noutstanding or that is controlled by a company that has a publicly traded security outstanding. 94\\nSecond, consistent with the current standardized approach, a banking organization would assign\\nrisk weights of 2 percent or 4 percent to certain exposures to a qualifying central counterparty.\"\\nThird, as discussed further below, a banking organization would assign a 130 percent risk weight\\nto a project finance exposure that is not a project finance operational phase exposure. Fourth, a\\nbanking organization would assign a 150 percent risk weight to a corporate exposure that is an\\nexposure to a subordinated debt instrument or an exposure to a covered debt instrument unless a\\ndeduction treatment is provided as described in section III.C.2.d. of this Supplementary\\nInformation.\\n95\\nFinally, a banking organization would assign a 100 percent risk weight to all other\\ncorporate exposures. Assigning a 100 percent risk weight to all other corporate exposures\\nappropriately reflects the relative risk of such corporate exposures, as the repayment methods for\\nthese exposures pose greater risks than those of publicly-traded corporate exposures that are\\ndeemed investment grade. A banking organization would also assign a 100 percent risk weight to\\n\\xe2\\x81\\xb94 Under \\xc2\\xa7___.2 of the current capital rule, a person or company controls a company if it: (1)\\nowns, controls, or holds with power to vote 25 percent or more of a class of voting securities of\\nthe company; or (2) consolidates the company for financial reporting purposes.

For example,\\ncorporate exposures subject to the 100 percent risk weight would include exposures (i) for the\\npurpose of acquiring or financing equipment where repayment of the exposure is dependent on\\nthe cash flows generated by either the equipment being financed or acquired, (ii) for the purpose\\nof acquiring or financing physical commodities where repayment of the exposure is dependent\\non the proceeds from the sale of the physical commodities, and (iii) project finance operational\\nphase exposures, as further discussed below.\\nInvestment grade companies with publicly traded securities outstanding\\nUnder the proposal, a banking organization would assign a 65 percent risk weight to a\\ncorporate exposure that is both (1) an exposure to a company that is investment grade, and (2)\\nwhere that company, or a parent that controls that company, has publicly traded securities\\noutstanding. This two-pronged test would serve as a reasonable basis for banking organizations\\nto identify exposures to obligors of sufficient creditworthiness to be eligible for a reduced risk\\nweight. The definition of investment grade directly addresses the credit quality of the exposure\\nby requiring that the entity or reference entity have adequate capacity to meet financial\\ncommitments, which means that the risk of its default is low and the full and timely repayment of\\nprincipal and interest is expected. A banking organization\\'s investment grade analysis is\\ndependent upon the banking organization\\'s underwriting criteria, judgment, and assumptions.\\ni.\\n96\\nUnder \\xc2\\xa7___.2 of the current capital rule, publicly-traded means traded on: (1) any exchange\\nregistered with the SEC as a national securities exchange under section 6 of the Securities\\nExchange Act; or (2) any non-U.S.-based securities exchange that: (i) is registered with, or\\napproved by, a national securities regulatory authority; and (ii) provides a liquid, two-way\\nmarket for the instrument in question. See 12 CFR 3.2 (OCC); 12 CFR 217.2 (Board); 12 CFR\\n324.2 (FDIC).\\nPage 89 of 1089\\nThe proposed requirement that the company or its parent company have securities\\noutstanding that are publicly traded, in contrast, would be a simple, objective criterion that would\\nprovide a degree of consistency across banking organizations. Further, publicly-traded corporate\\nentities are subject to enhanced transparency and market discipline as a result of being listed\\npublicly on an exchange. A banking organization would use these simple criteria, which\\ncomplement a banking organization\\'s due diligence and internal credit analysis, to determine\\nwhether a corporate exposure qualifies as an investment grade exposure.\\nQuestion 38: What, if any, alternative criteria should the agencies consider to identify\\ncorporate exposures that would warrant a risk weight of 65 percent or a risk weight between 65\\npercent and 100 percent?\\nQuestion 39: For what reasons, if any, should the agencies consider applying a lower\\nrisk weight than 100 percent to exposures to companies that are not publicly traded but are\\ncompanies that are \"highly regulated?\" What, if any, criteria should the agencies consider to\\nidentify companies that are \"highly regulated?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Alternatively, what are the advantages and\\ndisadvantages of assigning lower risk weights to highly regulated entities (such as open-ended\\nmutual funds, mutual insurance companies, pension funds, or registered investment companies)?\\nQuestion 40: What are the advantages and disadvantages of applying a lower risk weight\\n(such as between 85 and 100 percent), to entities based on size, such as companies with reported\\nannual sales of less than or equal to $50 million for the most recent financial year?

Please provide supporting data.\\nPage 90 of 1089\\nQuestion 41: What criteria, if any, should the agencies consider to further differentiate\\ncorporate exposures according to their risk profiles and what implications would such criteria\\nhave for the risk weighting of these exposures and why?\\nProject finance exposures\\nThe proposal would define a project finance exposure as a corporate exposure for which\\nthe banking organization relies on the revenues generated by a single project (typically a large\\nand complex installation, such as power plants, manufacturing plants, transportation\\ninfrastructure, telecommunications, or other similar installations), both as the source of\\nrepayment and as security for the loan. For example, a project finance exposure could take the\\nform of financing the construction of a new installation, or a refinancing of an existing\\ninstallation, with or without improvements. The primary determinant of credit risk for a project\\nfinance exposure is the variability of the cash flows expected to be generated by the project being\\nfinanced rather than the general creditworthiness of the obligor or the market value or sale of the\\nproject or the real estate on which the project sits.\\xe2\\x81\\xb97 A project finance exposure also would be\\nrequired to meet the following criteria: (1) the exposure would need to be to a borrowing entity\\nthat was created specifically to finance the project, operate the physical assets of the project, or\\ndo both, and (2) the borrowing entity would need to have an immaterial amount of assets,\\nactivities, or sources of income apart from revenues from the activities of the project being\\nfinanced. Under the proposal, an exposure that is deemed secured by real estate,\\xe2\\x81\\xb98 would not be\\n97\\n98\\n97\\nii.\\nExposures that are guaranteed by the government or considered a general obligation or\\nrevenue obligation exposure to a PSE would not qualify as a project finance exposure.\\n98 Although it is common for the banking organization to take a mortgage over the real property\\nand a lien against other assets of the project for security and lender control purposes, a project\\nfinance exposure would not be considered a real estate exposure because the banking\\norganization does not rely on real estate collateral to grant credit. As noted in section III.C.2.e of\\nPage 91 of 1089\\nconsidered a project finance exposure and would be assigned a risk weight as described in\\nsection III.C.2.e. of this Supplementary Information.\\nUnder the proposal, a project finance exposure would receive a 130 percent risk weight\\nduring the pre-operational phase and a 100 percent risk weight during the operational phase. The\\nproposal would define a project finance operational phase exposure as a project finance exposure\\nwhere the project has a positive net cash flow that is sufficient to support the debt service and\\nexpenses of the project and any other remaining contractual obligation, in accordance with the\\nbanking organization\\'s applicable loan underwriting criteria for permanent financings, and where\\nthe outstanding long-term debt of the project is declining. Prior to the operational phase\\nclassification, a banking organization would be required to treat a project finance exposure as\\nbeing in the pre-operational phase and assign a 130 percent risk weight to the exposure. The pre-\\noperational phase would be the period between the origination of the loan and the time at which\\nthe banking organization determines that the project has entered the operational phase. Relative\\nto the operational phase, the pre-operational phase presents increased uncertainty that the project\\nwill be completed in a timely and cost-effective manner, which warrants the application of a\\nhigher risk weight. For example, market conditions could change significantly between\\ncommencement and completion of the project. In addition, unanticipated supply shortages could\\ndisrupt timely completion of the project and the expected timing of the transition to the\\noperational phase. These unanticipated changes could disrupt the completion of the project and\\nthis Supplementary Information, for purposes of the proposal, \"secured by collateral in the form\\nof real estate\" in the context of the proposed real estate exposure definition should be interpreted\\nin a manner that is consistent with the current definition for \"a loan secured by real estate\" in the\\nCall Report and FR Y-9C instructions.\\nPage 92 of 1089\\ndelay it becoming operational, and thus impact the ability of the project to generate cash flows as\\nprojected and to repay creditors.\\nQuestion 42: What additional exposures, if any, should be captured by the proposed\\ndefinition of a project finance exposure? What exposures, if any, captured by the proposed\\ndefinition of a project finance exposure should be excluded from the definition?\\nQuestion 43: What clarifications or changes, if any, should the agencies consider to\\ndifferentiate project finance exposures from exposures secured by real estate? What, if any,\\ncapital market effects would the proposed treatment of project finance exposures have and why\\nand what, if any, modifications should the agencies consider to address such effects? How\\nmaterial for banking organizations are project finance exposures that are not based on the\\ncreditworthiness of a federal, state or local government?\\n3. Off-balance sheet exposures\\nIn addition to on-balance sheet exposures, banking organizations are exposed to credit\\nrisk associated with off-balance sheet exposures. Banking organizations often enter into\\ncontractual arrangements with borrowers or counterparties to provide credit or other support.\\nSuch arrangements generally are not recorded on-balance sheet under GAAP. These off-balance\\nsheet exposures often include commitments, contingent items, guarantees, certain repo-style\\ntransactions, financial standby letters of credit, and forward agreements.\\nThe proposal would introduce a few updated credit conversion factors that a banking\\norganization would apply to an off-balance sheet item\\'s notional amount (typically, the\\ncontractual amount) in order to calculate the exposure amount for an off-balance sheet exposure.\\nUnder the proposal, the credit conversion factors, which would range from 10 percent to 100\\npercent, would reflect the expected proportion of the off-balance sheet item that would become\\nPage 93 of 1089\\nan on-balance sheet credit exposure to the borrower, taking into account the contractual features\\nof the off-balance sheet item. For example, a guarantee provided by a banking organization\\nwould be subject to a 100 percent credit conversion factor because there generally is a high\\nprobability of the full amount of the guarantee becoming an on-balance sheet credit exposure. In\\ncontrast, under the terms of most commitments, banking organizations generally are not expected\\nto extend the full amount of credit agreed to in the contract. After determining the off-balance\\nsheet exposure amount, the banking organization would then multiply it by the appropriate risk\\nweight, as provided under section III.C.2. of the Supplementary Information, to arrive at the risk-\\nweighted asset amount for the off-balance sheet exposure, consistent with the calculation method\\nunder the current standardized approach.\\na. Commitments\\nThe proposal would maintain the existing definition of commitment under the current\\ncapital rule. The current capital rule defines a commitment as any legally binding arrangement\\nthat obligates a banking organization to extend credit or to purchase assets.9\\xe2\\x81\\xb9 A commitment can\\nexist even when the banking organization has the unilateral right to not extend credit at any time.\\nOff-balance sheet exposures such as credit cards allow obligors to borrow up to a\\nspecified amount. However, some off-balance sheet exposures such as charge cards do not have\\nan explicit contractual pre-set credit limit and generally require obligors to pay their balance in\\nfull each month. For commitments with no express contractual maximum amount or pre-set\\nlimit, the proposal would include an approach to calculate a proxy for the committed but\\nundrawn amount of the commitment (off-balance sheet notional amount), based on an averaging\\nformula over the previous two years (averaging methodology). A banking organization would\\n99\\nSee 12 CFR 3.2 (OCC); 12 CFR 217.2 (Board); 12 CFR 324.2 (FDIC).\\nPage 94 of 1089\\nfirst calculate the average total drawn amount of the commitment over the prior eight quarters or,\\nif the banking organization has offered such products to the obligor for fewer than eight quarters,\\nthe average total drawn amount since the commitment with no pre-set limit was first issued. The\\nbanking organization would then multiply the average total drawn amount by 10 to determine the\\noff-balance sheet notional amount. Next, the banking organization would determine the\\napplicable off-balance sheet exposure amount by first subtracting the current drawn amount from\\nthe calculated off-balance sheet notional amount and then multiplying this difference by the\\napplicable credit conversion factor (10 percent for an unconditionally cancelable commitment, as\\ndescribed in more detail in the following section). The risk-weighted asset amount would be the\\noff-balance sheet exposure amount multiplied by the applicable risk weight (e.g., 55 percent for a\\ntransactor retail exposure).\\nFor example, assume an obligor\\'s charge card had an average drawn amount of $4,000\\nover the prior eight quarters, and a drawn amount of $3,000 during the most recent reporting\\nquarter. To determine the off-balance sheet exposure amount of the charge card, a banking\\norganization would (1) multiply the average of $4,000 by 10 ($40,000), (2) subtract the current\\ndrawn amount of $3,000 from $40,000 ($37,000), and (3) multiply $37,000 by the 10 percent\\ncredit conversion factor for unconditionally cancellable commitments ($3,700). For purposes of\\nthis example, assume the obligor\\'s charge card would qualify as a regulatory retail exposure \\xc2\\xb900\\nthat is a transactor exposure. Applying the 55 percent risk weight for transactor exposures to the\\nexposure amount of $3,700. would result in a risk-weighted asset amount of $2,035.\\n100\\nAs discussed in section III.C.2.f of this Supplementary Information, a retail exposure would\\nneed to meet certain criteria and be evaluated against the aggregate and granularity limits to\\nqualify as a regulatory retail exposure.\\nPage 95 of 1089\\nThe proposed averaging methodology would apply a multiplier of 10 to the average total\\ndrawn amount because supervisory experience suggests that obligors similar to those with charge\\ncards have average credit utilization rates equal to approximately 10 percent. This approach uses\\nan eight-quarter average balance, as opposed to a shorter period, to better reflect a borrower\\'s\\ncredit usage, notably by mitigating the impact of seasonality and of short-term trends in drawn\\nbalances from the total credit exposure estimate.\\nQuestion 44: What are the advantages and disadvantages of the averaging methodology\\nto calculate a proxy for the undrawn credit exposure amount for commitments with no pre-set\\nlimits? What, if any, adjustments should the agencies consider to better reflect a borrower\\'s\\ncredit usage when calculating the undrawn portion of the credit exposures for commitments that\\nhave less than eight quarters of data, particularly those with less than a full quarter of data?\\nWhat, if any, alternative approaches should the agencies consider and why?\\nQuestion 45: What adjustments, if any, should the agencies make to the proposed\\nmultiplier of 10 for calculating the total off-balance sheet notional amount of the obligor under\\nthe proposed methodology and why?\\nb. Credit conversion factors\\nThe proposal would provide the same credit conversion factors in the current capital rule\\nexcept with respect to commitments. The proposal would modify the credit conversion factors\\napplicable to commitments and simplify the treatment relative to the current standardized\\napproach by no longer differentiating such factors by maturity. Under the proposal, a\\ncommitment, regardless of the maturity of the facility, would be subject to a credit conversion\\nfactor of 40 percent, except for the unused portion of a commitment that is unconditionally\\nPage 96 of 1089\\ncancelable 101\\n(to the extent permitted under applicable law) by the banking organization, which\\nwould be subject to a credit conversion factor of 10 percent. \\xc2\\xb902 Although unconditionally\\ncancellable commitments allow banking organizations to cancel such commitments at any time\\nwithout prior notice, in practice, banking organizations often extend credit or provide funding for\\nreputational reasons or to support the viability of borrowers to which the banking organization\\nhas significant ongoing exposure, even when borrowers are under economic stress. For example,\\nbanking organizations may have incentives to preserve substantial or core customer relationships\\nwhen there is a deterioration in creditworthiness that may, for less substantial customer\\nrelationships, cause the banking organization to cancel a commitment. Relative to the current\\nstandardized approach, the proposal would simplify the applicable credit conversion factor for all\\nother commitments given the 10 percent applicable credit conversion factor for unconditionally\\ncancellable commitments. A 40 percent credit conversion factor for other commitments is\\nappropriate because such commitments do not provide the banking organization the same\\nflexibility to exit the commitment compared with unconditionally cancellable commitments.\\nQuestion 46: What additional factors, if any, should the agencies consider for\\ndetermining the applicable credit conversion factors for commitments?\\n4. Derivatives\\n101 Under \\xc2\\xa7. 2 of the current capital rule, unconditionally cancelable means a commitment that\\na banking organization may, at any time, with or without cause, refuse to extend credit (to the\\nextent permitted under applicable law). See 12 CFR 3.2 (OCC); 12 CFR 217.2 (Board); 12 CFR\\n324.2 (FDIC).\\n102\\nUnder the proposal, a 40 percent CCF would also apply to commitments that are not\\nunconditionally cancelable commitments for purposes of calculating total leverage exposure for\\nthe supplementary leverage ratio.\\nPage 97 of 1089\\nThe current capital rule requires banking organizations to calculate risk-weighted assets\\nbased on the exposure amount of their derivative contracts and prescribes different approaches\\nfor measuring the exposure amount of derivative contracts based on the size and risk profile of\\nthe banking organization. The proposal would expand the scope of banking organizations that\\nwould be required to use one of the approaches, SA-CCR, which was adopted in January 2020\\n(the SA-CCR final rule),\\xc2\\xb903 and make certain technical revisions to that approach. The current\\ncapital rule requires banking organizations subject to Category I or II capital standards to utilize\\nSA-CCR or the internal models methodology to calculate their advanced approaches total risk-\\nweighted assets and to utilize SA-CCR to calculate standardized total risk-weighted assets.\\nThe current capital rule permits banking organizations subject to Category III or IV capital\\nstandards to utilize the current exposure methodology or SA-CCR to calculate standardized total\\nrisk-weighted assets. 105\\nAs discussed in section II of this Supplementary Information, the proposal would require\\ninstitutions subject to Category III or IV capital standards to use the expanded risk-based\\napproach, which includes the requirement to use SA-CCR, and would eliminate the internal\\nmodels methodology as an available approach to calculate the exposure amount of derivative\\ncontracts. Therefore, under the proposal, large banking organizations would be required to use\\nSA-CCR to calculate regulatory capital ratios under the standardized approach, expanded risk-\\nbased approach, and supplementary leverage ratio.\\n103\\n85 FR 4362 (January 24, 2020).\\n104\\n104 12 CFR 3.34 (OCC); 12 CFR 217.34 (Board); 12 CFR 324.34 (FDIC).\\n105 Id.\\nPage 98 of 1089\\nThe agencies are also proposing technical revisions to SA-CCR to assist banking\\norganizations in implementing SA-CCR in a consistent manner and with an exposure\\nmeasurement that more appropriately reflects the counterparty credit risks posed by derivative\\ntransactions.\\na. Proposed technical revisions\\ni. Treatment of collateral held by a qualifying central counterparty (QCCP)\\nUnder the current capital rule, a clearing member banking organization using SA-CCR\\nmust determine its capital requirement for a default fund contribution to a QCCP based on the\\nhypothetical capital requirement for the QCCP (KCCP) using SA-CCR.106 The calculation of KCCP\\nrequires calculating the exposure amount of the QCCP to each of its clearing members. In the\\ncalculation of the exposure amount, the SA-CCR final rule allows the exposure amount of the\\nQCCP to each clearing member to be reduced by all collateral held by the QCCP posted by the\\nclearing member and by the amount of prefunded default fund contributions provided by the\\nclearing member to the QCCP. However, this treatment is inconsistent with the calculation of the\\nexposure amount for a netting set, in which collateral is not subtracted from the exposure amount\\nbut is instead a component of the calculations of both the replacement cost (RC) and potential\\nfuture exposure (PFE).\\nThe proposal would change how collateral posted to a QCCP by clearing members and\\nthe amount of clearing members\\' prefunded default fund contributions factor into the\\ncalculation of Kccp. This treatment, which is more sensitive to the risk-reducing benefits of\\ncollateral, would allow the proper recognition of collateral in calculating the exposure amount\\nof a QCCP to its clearing members and would be consistent with the calculation of the\\n106\\nSee 12 CFR 3.133(d) (OCC); 12 CFR 217.133(d) (Board); 12 CFR 324.133(d) (FDIC)\\nPage 99 of 1089\\nexposure amount for a netting set. Specifically, for the purpose of calculating the exposure\\namount of a QCCP to a clearing member, the net independent collateral amount that appears in\\nthe RC and PFE calculations would be replaced by the sum of:\\n1) the fair value amount of the independent collateral posted to a QCCP by a\\nclearing member;\\n2) the fair value amount of the independent collateral posted to a QCCP by a\\nclearing member on behalf of a client, in connection with derivative contracts for which\\nthe clearing member has provided a guarantee to the QCCP; and\\n3) the amount of the prefunded default fund contribution of the clearing member\\nto the QCCP.\\nBoth the amount of independent collateral and the prefunded default fund contribution\\nwould be adjusted by the standard supervisory haircuts under Table 1 to section .121 of the\\nproposal, as applicable.\\nii. Treatment of collateral held in a bankruptcy-remote manner\\nBoth the standardized approach and the advanced approaches under the current capital\\nrule require a banking organization to determine the trade exposure amount for derivative\\ncontracts transacted through a central counterparty (CCP).\\nWhen calculating its trade exposure amount for a cleared transaction, a banking\\norganization under both the standardized and advanced approaches under the capital rule may\\nexclude collateral posted to the CCP that is held in a bankruptcy-remote manner by the CCP or a\\ncustodian. In the SA-CCR final rule, the agencies inadvertently imposed heightened\\nrequirements for the exclusion of collateral from the trade exposure amount posted by a clearing\\nPage 100 of 1089\\nmember banking organizations to a CCP under the advanced approaches. 107 The expanded risk-\\nbased approach does not include these heightened requirements and would align the\\nrequirements for the exclusion of collateral from the trade exposure amount of banking\\norganizations under both the standardized and expanded risk-based approach.\\n111. Supervisory delta for collateralized debt obligation (CDO) tranches\\nUnder the SA-CCR final rule, a banking organization must apply a supervisory delta\\nadjustment to account for the sensitivity of a derivative contract (scaled to unit size) to the\\nunderlying primary risk factor, including the correct sign (positive or negative) to account for the\\ndirection of the derivative contract amount relative to the primary risk factor.\\xc2\\xb9\\n108\\nFor a derivative contract that is a CDO tranche, the supervisory delta adjustment is\\ncalculated using the formula below:\\n15\\n(1+14*A)*(1+14*D)\\nwhere A is the attachment point and D is the detachment point.\\nThe SA-CCR final rule applies a positive sign to the resulting amount if the banking\\norganization purchased the CDO tranche and applies a negative sign if the banking organization\\nsold the CDO tranche. However, the appropriate sign to account for the purchasing or selling of\\nCDO tranches can be ambiguous: purchasing a CDO tranche can be interpreted as selling credit\\nSupervisory delta adjustment =\\n107 12 CFR 3.133(c)(4)(i) (OCC); 12 CFR 217.133(c)(4)(i) (Board); 12 CFR 324.133(c)(4)(i)\\n(FDIC).\\n108\\nFor the supervisory delta adjustment, a banking organization applies a positive sign to the\\nderivative contract amount if the derivative contract is long the risk factor and a negative sign if\\nthe derivative contract is short the risk factor. A derivative contract is long the primary risk\\nfactor if the fair value of the instrument increases when the value of the primary risk factor\\nincreases. A derivative contract is short the primary risk factor if the fair value of the\\ninstrument decreases when the value of the primary risk factor increases.\\nPage 101 of 1089\\nprotection, while selling a CDO tranche can be interpreted as purchasing credit protection. In\\norder to ensure the correct sign of the supervisory delta adjustment for CDO tranches that would\\nresult in a proper aggregation of CDO tranches with linear credit derivative contracts in PFE\\ncalculations, the proposal would revise the sign specification for the supervisory delta adjustment\\nfor CDO tranches as follows: positive if the CDO tranches were used to purchase credit\\nprotection by the banking organization and negative if the CDO tranches were used to sell credit\\nprotection by the banking organization.\\niv. Supervisory delta for options contracts\\nUnder the SA-CCR final rule, the supervisory delta adjustment for option contracts is\\ncalculated based on the Black-Scholes formulas for delta sensitivity of European call and put\\noption contracts. The original Black-Scholes formula for a European option contract\\'s delta\\nsensitivity assumes a lognormal probability distribution for the value of the instrument or risk\\nfactor underlying the option contract, thus precluding negative values for both the current value\\nof the underlying instrument or risk factor and the strike price of the option contract. The SA-\\nCCR final rule uses modified Black-Scholes formulas that are based on a shifted lognormal\\nprobability distribution, which allows negative values of the underlying instrument or risk factor\\nwith the magnitude not exceeding the value of a shift parameter \\xce\\xbb (lambda). The SA-CCR final\\nrule sets \\xce\\xbb to zero (thus precluding negative values) for all asset classes except the interest rate\\nasset class, which has exhibited negative values in some currencies in recent years. For the\\ninterest rate asset class, a banking organization must set the value of for a given currency equal\\nto the greater of (i) the negative of the lowest value of the strike prices and the current values of\\nthe interest rate underlying all interest rate options in a given currency that the banking\\norganization has with all counterparties plus 0.1 percent; and (ii) zero.\\nPage 102 of 1089\\nHowever, negative values of the instrument or risk factor underlying an option contract\\ncan occur in other asset classes as well. For example, whenever an option contract references the\\ndifference between the values of two instruments or risk factors, the underlying spread of this\\noption contract can be negative. Such option contracts are commonly traded in the OTC\\nderivatives market, including option contracts on the spread between two commodity prices and\\non the difference performance across two equity indices. Under the current capital rule,\\nbanking organizations cannot calculate the supervisory delta adjustment for any option contract\\nother than an interest rate derivative contract if the strike price or the current value of the\\nunderlying instrument or risk factor is negative because the SA-CCR final rule only allows a\\nnon-zero value for \\xce\\xbb for interest rate derivative contracts. To ensure that a banking organization\\nis able to calculate the supervisory delta adjustment for option contracts when the underlying\\ninstrument or risk factor has a negative value, the proposal would extend the use of the shift\\nparameter \\xce\\xbb to all asset classes. More specifically, for non-interest-rate asset classes, the proposal\\nwould require a banking organization to use the same value of \\xce\\xbb for all option contracts that\\nreference the same underlying instrument or risk factor. If the value of the underlying instrument\\nor risk factor cannot be negative, the value of 2 would be set to zero. Otherwise, to determine the\\nvalue of \\xce\\xbb for a given risk factor or instrument, the proposal would require a banking\\norganization to find the lowest value L of the strike price and the current value of the underlying\\ninstrument or risk factor of all option contracts that reference this instrument or risk factor with\\nall counterparties. The proposal would require a banking organization to set \\xce\\xbb for this instrument\\nor risk factor according to the formula \\xce\\xbb=max{-1.1\\xc2\\xb7L,0}. The purpose of multiplying negative L\\nby 1.1 (thus, resulting in -1.1\\xc2\\xb7L) is the same as that for adding 0.1 percent in the case of interest\\nrate derivative contracts under the SA-CCR final rule: to set the lowest possible value of the\\nPage 103 of 1089\\nunderlying instrument or risk factor slightly below the lowest observed value. Because it is\\nchallenging to determine a universal additive offset value for all values of non-interest-rate\\ninstruments and risk factors, the offset would be performed via multiplication for asset classes\\nother than the interest rate asset class.\\nThe proposal would also permit a banking organization, with the approval of its primary\\nFederal supervisor, to specify a different value for \\xce\\xbb for purposes of the supervisory delta\\nadjustment for option contracts other than interest rate option contracts, if a different value for\\nwould be appropriate, considering the range of values for the instrument or risk factor underlying\\noption contracts. This flexibility would allow a banking organization to use a specific value for\\n\\xce\\xbb, rather than the value resulting from the proposed formula described above, in the event that a\\ndifferent value for \\xce\\xbb is more appropriate than the value resulting from the formula. A banking\\norganization that specifies a different value for \\xce\\xbb would be required to assign the same value for\\n\\xce\\xbb to all option contracts with the same underlying instrument or risk factor, as applicable, with all\\ncounterparties. This proposed provision is intended to permit a banking organization, with\\napproval from its primary Federal supervisor, to account for unanticipated outcomes in the\\nsupervisory delta adjustment of certain asset classes while avoiding arbitrage between assets in\\nthat class.\\nQuestion 47: What other approaches should the agencies consider to calibrate the\\nlambda parameter for non-interest-rate asset classes, such as a formula that is different from the\\nproposed formula of \\xce\\xbb=max{-1.1-L,0}, and why? What values besides 1.1, if any, should the\\nagencies consider for the value of the multiplier in the proposed formula? Why?\\nDecomposition of credit, equity, and commodity indices\\nV.\\nPage 104 of 1089\\n109\\nUnder the capital rule, banking organizations are permitted to decompose indices within\\ncredit, equity, and commodity asset classes, such that a banking organization would treat each\\ncomponent of the index as a separate single-name derivative contract. The capital rule requires\\nthat if a banking organization elects to decompose indices within the credit, equity, and\\ncommodity asset classes, the banking organization must perform all calculations in determining\\nthe exposure amount based on the underlying instrument rather than the index. While this is\\npossible for linear indices, for non-linear index contracts (e.g., those with optionality and CDS\\nindex tranches) it is not mathematically possible to calculate the supervisory delta for an\\nunderlying component, as the delta associated with the non-linear index applies at the instrument\\nlevel. In recognition of this fact, the agencies are clarifying that the option to decompose a non-\\nlinear index is not available under SA-CCR. Additionally, the agencies are clarifying that if\\nelecting to decompose a linear index, banking organizations must apply the weights used by the\\nindex when determining the exposure amounts for the underlying instrument.\\n5. Credit risk mitigation\\nThe current capital rule permits banking organizations to recognize certain types of credit\\nrisk mitigants, such as guarantees, credit derivatives, and collateral, for risk-based capital\\npurposes provided the credit risk mitigants satisfy the qualification standards under the rule.110\\nCredit derivatives and guarantees can reduce the credit risk of an exposure by placing a legal\\nobligation on a third-party protection provider to compensate the banking organization for losses\\n109\\nSee 12 CFR 3.132(c)(5)(vi) (OCC); 12 CFR 217.132(c)(5)(vi) (Board); 12 CFR\\n324.132(c)(5)(vi) (FDIC).\\n110 Consistent with the current capital rule, the proposal would not require banking organizations\\nto recognize any instrument as a credit risk mitigant. Credit derivatives that a banking\\norganization cannot or chooses not to recognize as a credit risk mitigant would be subject to a\\nseparate counterparty credit risk capital requirement.\\nPage 105 of 1089\\nin the event of a borrower default.\\xc2\\xb9\\xc2\\xb9\\xc2\\xb9 Similarly, the use of collateral can reduce the credit risk of\\nan exposure by creating the right of a banking organization to take ownership of and liquidate the\\ncollateral in the event of a default by the counterparty. Prudent use of such mitigants can help a\\nbanking organization reduce the credit risk of an exposure and thereby reduce the risk-based\\ncapital requirement associated with that exposure.\\nCredit risk mitigants recognized for risk-based capital purposes must be of sufficiently\\nhigh quality to effectively reduce credit risk. For guarantees and credit derivatives, the current\\ncapital rule primarily looks to the creditworthiness of the guarantor and the features of the\\nunderlying contract to determine whether these forms of credit risk mitigation may be recognized\\nfor risk-based capital purposes (eligible guarantee or eligible credit derivative). With respect to\\ncollateralized transactions, the current capital rule primarily looks to the liquidity profile and\\nquality of the collateral received and the nature of the banking organization\\'s security interest to\\ndetermine whether the collateral qualifies as financial collateral that may be recognized for\\npurposes of risk-based capital.\\xc2\\xb912\\nAs stated earlier, the proposal would eliminate the use of models for credit risk under the\\ncurrent capital rule. Therefore, the proposal would replace certain methodologies for recognizing\\nthe risk-reducing benefits of financial collateral and eligible guarantees and credit derivatives\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\nnamely, the internal models methodology, simple VaR approach, PD substitution approach, LGD\\nadjustment approach, and double default treatment with the standardized approaches described\\nbelow. For eligible guarantees and eligible credit derivatives, the proposal would permit banking\\n111 Credit events are defined in the documents governing the credit risk mitigant and often\\ninclude events such as failure to pay principal and interest and entry into insolvency or similar\\nproceedings.\\n112\\nSee 12 CFR 3.2, 217.2, and 324.2 for the definition of financial collateral.\\nPage 106 of 1089\\norganizations to use the substitution approach from subpart D of the current capital rule with a\\nmodification for eligible credit derivatives that do not include restructuring as a credit event.\\nFurther, the proposal would no longer permit the recognition of credit protection from nth-to-\\ndefault credit derivatives.113 For all collateralized transactions, the corporate issuer of any\\nfinancial collateral in the form of a corporate debt security must have an outstanding publicly\\ntraded security or the corporate issuer must be controlled by a company that has an outstanding\\npublicly traded security in order to be recognized. For collateralized transactions where financial\\ncollateral secures exposures that are not derivative contracts or netting sets of derivative\\ncontracts, the proposal would permit banking organizations to use the simple approach from\\nsubpart D without any modification. For eligible margin loans and repo-style transactions, the\\nproposal would also permit banking organizations to use the collateral haircut approach with\\nstandard supervisory market price volatility haircuts\\xc2\\xb9 from subpart D with two proposed\\nmodifications to increase risk sensitivity: (1) adjustments to the market price volatility haircuts\\nand (2) a modified formula for netting sets of eligible margin loans or repo-style transactions that\\nreflects netting and diversification benefits within netting sets. Finally, the proposal would\\nintroduce minimum haircut floors for certain eligible margin loan and repo-style transactions\\nwith unregulated financial institutions that banking organizations must meet in order to recognize\\nthe risk-mitigation benefits of financial collateral.\\nIn connection with the removal of the internal models methodology, the proposal would\\nmake corresponding revisions to reflect this change in the definition of a netting set. Compared\\n,114\\n113\\nSee section III.D.3.a of this Supplementary Information.\\nUnder subpart D, banking organizations also are permitted to use their own estimates of\\nmarket price volatility haircuts, with prior written approval from the primary federal supervisors.\\nThe proposal would not include this option in subpart E as the agencies have found it to\\nintroduce unwarranted variability in banking organizations\\' risk-weighted assets.\\n114\\nPage 107 of 1089\\nto the current capital rule, the proposal would exclude cross-product netting sets from the\\ndefinition of a netting set, as none of the proposed approaches under the revised framework\\nwould recognize cross-product netting. This would be consistent with the current capital rule,\\nwhich also does not recognize cross-product netting. Therefore, the proposal would define a\\nnetting set as a group of single-product transactions with a single counterparty that are subject to\\na qualifying master netting agreement (QMNA)\\xc2\\xb9\\xc2\\xb95 and that consist only of one of the following:\\nderivative contracts, repo-style transactions, or eligible margin loans. For purposes of the\\nproposed netting set definition, the netting set must include the same product (i.e., all derivative\\ncontracts or all repo-style transactions or all eligible margin loans). Consistent with the current\\ncapital rule, for derivative contracts, the proposed definition of netting set would also include a\\nsingle derivative contract between a banking organization and a single counterparty.\\nQuestion 48: What would be the impact of requiring that certain debt securities must be\\nissued by a publicly-traded company, or issued by a company controlled by a publicly-traded\\ncompany, in order to qualify as financial collateral and what, if any, alternatives should the\\nagencies consider to this requirement?\\na. Guarantees and credit derivatives\\ni. Substitution approach\\nAs under subpart D in the current capital rule, under the proposal a banking organization\\nwould be permitted to recognize the credit-risk-mitigation benefits of eligible guarantees and\\n115\\nSee 12 CFR 3.2, 217.2, and 324.2 for the definition of qualifying master netting agreement.\\nPage 108 of 1089\\neligible credit derivatives by substituting the risk weight applicable to the eligible guarantor or\\nprotection provider for the risk weight applicable to the hedged exposure.116\\nii. Adjustment for credit derivatives without restructuring as a credit event\\nCredit derivative contracts in certain jurisdictions include debt restructuring as a credit\\nevent that triggers a payment obligation by the protection provider to the protection purchaser.\\nSuch restructurings of the hedged exposure may involve forgiveness or postponement of\\nprincipal, interest, or fees that result in a loss to investors. Consistent with the current capital\\nrule, the proposal would generally require a banking organization that seeks to recognize the\\ncredit risk-mitigation benefits of an eligible credit derivative that does not include a restructuring\\nof the reference exposure as a credit event to reduce the effective notional amount of the credit\\nderivative by 40 percent to account for any unmitigated losses that could occur as a result of a\\nrestructuring of the hedged exposure.\\nUnder the proposal, however, the 40 percent adjustment would not apply to eligible credit\\nderivatives without restructuring as a credit event if both of the following requirements are\\nsatisfied: (1) the terms of the hedged exposure (and the reference exposure, if different from the\\nhedged exposure) allow the maturity, principal, coupon, currency, or seniority status to be\\namended outside of receivership, insolvency, liquidation, or similar proceeding only by\\nunanimous consent of all parties; and (2) the banking organization has conducted sufficient legal\\nreview to conclude with a well-founded basis (and maintains sufficient written documentation of\\nthat legal review) that the hedged exposure is subject to the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or a domestic\\n116 Under subpart E in the current capital rule, an eligible guarantee need not be issued by an\\neligible guarantor unless the exposure is a securitization exposure. The proposal would require\\nall eligible guarantees to be issued by an eligible guarantor.\\nPage 109 of 1089\\nor foreign insolvency regime with similar features that allows for a company to reorganize or\\nrestructure and provides for an orderly settlement of creditor claims.\\nThe unanimous consent requirement would mean that, for restructurings occurring\\noutside of an insolvency proceeding, all holders of the hedged exposure (and the reference\\nexposure, if different from the hedged exposure) must agree to any restructuring for the\\nrestructuring to occur, and no holder can vote against the restructuring or abstain. This\\nunanimous consent requirement would reduce the risk that a banking organization would suffer a\\ncredit loss on the hedged exposure that would not be offset by a payment under the eligible credit\\nderivative. Banking organizations generally would only be incentivized to vote for a\\nrestructuring if the terms of the restructuring would provide a more beneficial outcome to the\\nbanking organization relative to insolvency proceedings that would trigger payment under the\\neligible credit derivative. Additionally, the unanimous consent requirement for the reference\\nexposure, if different from the hedged exposure, would add an additional layer of security by\\nsignificantly reducing the probability of reaching a restructuring agreement that results in a loss\\nof principal or interest for creditors without triggering payment under the eligible credit\\nderivative. The unanimous consent requirement would need to be satisfied through the terms of\\nthe hedged exposure (and the reference exposure, if different from the hedged exposure), which\\ncould be accomplished through a contractual provision of the exposure or the application of law.\\nThe requirement that the hedged exposure be subject to the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or a\\nsimilar domestic or foreign insolvency regime would help to ensure that any restructuring is done\\nin an orderly, predictable, and regulated process. In the event that the obligor of the hedged\\nexposure defaults and the default is not cured, the obligor would either be required to enter\\ninsolvency proceedings, which would trigger payment under the credit derivative, or the obligor\\nPage 110 of 1089\\nwould be required to pursue restructuring outside of insolvency, which could not occur without\\nthe banking organization\\'s consent. Together, the proposed requirements would ensure that\\ncredit derivatives that do not include restructuring as a credit event but provide similarly\\neffective protection as those that do contain such provisions, are afforded similar recognition\\nunder the capital framework.\\nQuestion 49: The agencies seek comment on the appropriateness of allowing banking\\norganizations to recognize in full the effective notional amount of credit derivatives that do not\\ninclude restructuring as a credit event, if certain conditions are met. Is the exemption from the\\n40 percent haircut overly broad? If so, why, and how might the exemption be narrowed to only\\ncapture the types of credit derivatives that provide protection similar to credit derivatives that\\ninclude restructuring as a credit event?\\nQuestion 50: To what extent is the proposed treatment of eligible credit derivatives that\\ndo not include restructuring of the reference exposure as a credit event relevant outside of the\\nUnited States?\\nb. Collateralized transactions\\nThe proposal would only allow a banking organization to recognize the risk-mitigating\\nbenefits of a corporate debt security that meets the definition of financial collateral in expanded\\nrisk-weighted assets if the corporate issuer of the debt security has a publicly traded security\\noutstanding or is controlled by a company that has a publicly traded security outstanding.\\nCorporations with publicly traded securities typically are subject to mandatory regulatory and\\npublic reporting and disclosure requirements, and therefore debt securities issued by such\\ncorporations may be a more stable and liquid form of collateral.\\ni. Simple approach\\nPage 111 of 1089\\nSubpart D of the current capital rule includes the simple approach, which allows a\\nbanking organization to recognize the risk-mitigating benefits of financial collateral received by\\nsubstituting the risk weight applicable to an exposure with the risk weight applicable to the\\nfinancial collateral securing the exposure, generally subject to a 20 percent floor. The proposal\\ngenerally would maintain the simple approach of the current capital rule, including restrictions\\non collateral eligibility and the risk-weight floor, except for the proposed requirement for certain\\ncorporate debt securities.\\nii. Collateral haircut approach\\nUnder the current capital rule, a banking organization may recognize the credit risk-\\nmitigation benefits of repo-style transactions, eligible margin loans, and netting sets of such\\ntransactions by adjusting its exposure amount to its counterparty to recognize any financial\\ncollateral received and any collateral posted to the counterparty. Subpart E of the current capital\\nrule includes several approaches that a banking organization may use and some of those\\napproaches include the use of models that contribute to variability in risk-weighted assets. For\\nthis reason, under the proposal a banking organization would no longer be allowed to use the\\nsimple VaR approach or the internal models methodology to calculate the exposure amount, nor\\nwould a banking organization be permitted to use its own internal estimates for calculating\\nhaircuts. The proposal would broadly retain the collateral haircut approach with standard\\nsupervisory market volatility haircuts with some modifications. This approach would require a\\nbanking organization to adjust the fair value of the collateral received and posted to account for\\nany potential market price volatility in the value of the collateral during the margin period of\\nrisk, as well as to address any differences in currency. To increase the risk-sensitivity of the\\ncollateral haircut approach, the proposal would modify certain market price volatility haircuts.\\nPage 112 of 1089\\nThe proposal would also introduce a new method to calculate the exposure amount of eligible\\ntransactions in a netting set and simplify the existing exposure calculation method for individual\\ntransactions that are not part of a netting set.\\nExposure amount\\nThe proposal would provide two methods for calculating the exposure amount under the\\ncollateral haircut approach for eligible margin loans and repo-style transactions. One method\\nwould apply to individual eligible margin loans and repo-style transactions, the other to single-\\nproduct netting sets of such transactions, as described below. The new formula for netting sets\\nwould allow for the recognition of the risk-mitigating benefits of netting and portfolio\\ndiversification and is intended to provide for increased risk-sensitivity of the capital requirement\\nfor such transactions relative to the current capital rule.\\nI.\\nExposure amount for transactions not in a netting set\\nUnder the collateral haircut approach, the proposed exposure amount for an individual\\neligible margin loan or repo-style transaction that is not part of a netting set would yield the same\\nresult as the exposure amount equation in the current capital rule. However, the proposal would\\nchange the variables and structure to provide a simplified calculation for an individual eligible\\nmargin loan or repo-style transaction in comparison with transactions that are part of a netting\\nset. Specifically, the proposal would require a banking organization to calculate the exposure\\namount as the greater of zero and the difference of the following two quantities: (1) the value of\\nthe exposure, adjusted by the market price volatility haircut applicable to the exposure for a\\npotential increase in the exposure amount; and (2) the value of the collateral, adjusted by the\\nmarket price volatility haircut applicable to the collateral for a potential decrease in the collateral\\nvalue and the currency mismatch haircut applicable where the currency of the collateral is\\nA.\\nPage 113 of 1089\\ndifferent from the settlement currency. The banking organization would use the market price\\nvolatility haircuts and a standard 8 percent currency mismatch haircut, subject to adjustments, as\\ndescribed in the following section. Specifically, the exposure amount for an individual eligible\\nmargin loan or repo-style transaction that is not in a netting set would be based on the following\\nformula:\\nWhere:\\n\\xe2\\x97\\x8f\\n\\xe2\\x97\\x8f\\nE* = max{0; E \\xc3\\x97 (1 + H\\xe2\\x82\\x82) \\xe2\\x88\\x92 C \\xc3\\x97 (1 \\xe2\\x88\\x92 Hc \\xe2\\x80\\x94 H\\xc6\\x92x)}\\nE* is the exposure amount of the transaction after credit risk mitigation.\\nE is the current fair value of the specific instrument, cash, or gold the banking\\norganization has lent, sold subject to repurchase, or posted as collateral to the\\ncounterparty.\\nHe is the haircut appropriate to E as described in Table 1, as applicable.\\nC is the current fair value of the specific instrument, cash, or gold the banking\\norganization has borrowed, purchased subject to resale, or taken as collateral from\\nthe counterparty.\\nHe is the haircut appropriate to C as described in Table 1, as applicable.\\nC\\nH\\xc6\\x92 is the haircut appropriate for currency mismatch between the collateral and\\nJx\\nexposure.\\nThe first component in the above formula, E \\xc3\\x97 (1 + H\\xe2\\x82\\x82), would capture the current\\nvalue of the specific instrument, cash, or gold the banking organization has lent, sold subject to\\nrepurchase, or posted as collateral to the counterparty by the banking organization in the eligible\\nmargin loan or repo-style transaction, while accounting for the market price volatility of the\\ninstrument type. The second component in the above formula, C \\xc3\\x97 (1 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Hc \\xe2\\x80\\x94 H\\xc6\\x92x), would\\nPage 114 of 1089\\ncapture the current value of the specific instrument, cash, or gold the banking organization has\\nborrowed, purchased subject to resale, or taken as collateral from the counterparty in the eligible\\nmargin loan or repo-style transaction, while accounting for the market price volatility of the\\nspecific instrument as well as any adjustment to reflect currency mismatch, if applicable.\\nB. Exposure amount for transactions in a netting set\\nUnder the collateral haircut approach, the proposal would provide a new, more risk-\\nsensitive equation that recognizes diversification benefits by taking into consideration the\\nnumber of securities included in a netting set of eligible margin loans or repo-style transactions.\\nUnder this approach, the exposure amount for a netting set of eligible margin loans or repo-style\\ntransactions would equal:\\nE* = max 0;\\nWhere:\\n\\xe2\\x97\\x8f\\n\\xe2\\x97\\x8f\\n(\\xce\\xa3\\nE\\xe2\\x82\\x81\\n-\\xce\\xa3\\xe2\\x82\\x81) +\\nC\\xe2\\x82\\x81 ) + \\n(0.4 \\xc3\\x97 netexposure) + (0.6 \\xc3\\x97\\n\\xce\\xa3(Efx \\xc3\\x97 Hfx)\\nfx\\nE* is the exposure amount of the netting set after credit risk mitigation.\\nEi is the current fair value of the instrument, cash, or gold the banking\\norganization has lent, sold subject to repurchase, or posted as collateral to the\\ngrossexposure\\n\\xe2\\x88\\x9aN\\ncounterparty.\\nC\\xe2\\x82\\x81 is the current fair value of the instrument, cash, or gold the banking\\norganization has borrowed, purchased subject to resale, or taken as collateral from\\nthe counterparty.\\nnet exposure = Es EsH\\xe2\\x82\\x82|\\nPage 115 of 1089\\n\\xe2\\x97\\x8f\\n\\xe2\\x97\\x8f\\ngross exposure = \\xce\\xa3s Es|H\\xe2\\x82\\x82|\\nEs is the absolute value of the net position in a given instrument or in gold (where\\nthe net position in a given instrument or gold equals the sum of the current fair\\nvalues of the instrument or gold the banking organization has lent, sold subject to\\nrepurchase, or posted as collateral to the counterparty, minus the sum of the\\ncurrent fair values of that same instrument or gold the banking organization has\\nborrowed, purchased subject to resale, or taken as collateral from the\\ncounterparty).\\nH\\xc3\\xa8 is the haircut appropriate to Es as described in Table 1, as applicable. H\\xc3\\xa8 has a\\npositive sign if the instrument or gold is net lent, sold subject to repurchase, or\\nposted as collateral to the counterparty; He has a negative sign if the instrument or\\ngold is net borrowed, purchased subject to resale, or taken as collateral from the\\ncounterparty.\\nN is the number of instruments in the netting set with a unique Committee on\\nUniform Securities Identification Procedures (CUSIP) designation or foreign\\nequivalent, with certain exceptions. N would include any instrument with a unique\\nCUSIP that the banking organization lends, sells subject to repurchase, or posts as\\ncollateral, as well as any instrument with a unique CUSIP that the banking\\norganization borrows, purchases subject to resale, or takes as collateral. However,\\nN would not include collateral instruments that the banking organization is not\\npermitted to include within the credit risk mitigation framework (such as\\nnonfinancial collateral that is not part of a repo-style transaction included in the\\nbanking organization\\'s market risk weighted assets) or elects not to include within\\nPage 116 of 1089\\nthe credit risk mitigation framework. The number of instruments for N would also\\nnot include any instrument (or gold) for which the value Es is less than one-tenth\\nof the value of the largest Es in the netting set. Any amount of gold would be\\ngiven a value of one.\\nEfx is the absolute value of the net position in each currency fx different from the\\nsettlement currency.\\nH\\xc6\\x92 is the haircut appropriate for currency mismatch of currency fx.\\nThe first component in the above formula, (\\xce\\xa3; E\\xc2\\xa1 \\xe2\\x80\\x94 \\xce\\xa3; C;), would capture the baseline\\nexposure of a netting set of eligible margin loans or repo-style transactions after accounting for\\nthe value of any collateral. The second, (0.4 \\xc3\\x97 netexposure), and third, (0.6 \\xc3\\x97\\ngrossexposure\\n\\xe2\\x88\\x9aN\\n117\\ncomponents in the above formula would reflect the systematic risk (based on the net exposure)\\n117\\nand the idiosyncratic risk\\xc2\\xb9\\xc2\\xb97 (based on the gross exposure) of the netting set of eligible margin\\nloans or repo-style transactions covered by a QMNA. Under the proposal, the net exposure\\ncomponent would allow the formula to recognize netting at the level of the netting set and\\ncorrelations in the movement of market prices for instruments lent and received. Additionally,\\nbecause the contribution from the gross exposure component to the exposure amount would\\ndecrease proportionally with an increase in the number of unique instruments by CUSIP\\ndesignations or foreign equivalent, the gross exposure would capture the impact of portfolio\\ndiversification. The fourth component, (\\xce\\xa3fx(E\\xc6\\x92x \\xc3\\x97 H\\xc6\\x92x)), would capture any adjustment to\\nreflect currency mismatch, if applicable.\\nSystematic risk represents risks that are impacted by broad market variables (such as\\neconomy, region, and sector). Idiosyncratic risk represents risks that are endemic to a specific\\nasset, borrower, or counterparty.\\nPage 117 of 1089\\nWhen determining the market price volatility and currency mismatch haircuts, the\\nbanking organization would use the market price volatility haircuts described in the following\\nsection and a standard 8 percent currency mismatch haircut, subject to certain adjustments.\\nQuestion 51: What are the advantages and disadvantages of the proposed methodology\\nfor calculating the exposure amount for eligible margin loans and repo-style transactions\\ncovered by a QMNA?\\nQuestion 52: What would be the advantages and disadvantages of an alternative method\\nto calculate the number of instruments N based on the number of legal entities that issued or\\nguaranteed the instruments?\\nII.\\nMarket price volatility haircuts\\nUnder the proposal, a banking organization would apply the market price volatility\\nhaircut appropriate for the type of collateral, as provided in Table 1 below, in the exposure\\namount calculation for repo-style transactions, eligible margin loans, and netting sets thereof\\nusing the collateral haircut approach and in the calculation of the net independent collateral\\namount and the variation margin amount for collateralized derivative transactions using SA-\\nCCR. Consistent with the current capital rule, the proposal would require banking organizations\\nto apply an 8 percent supervisory haircut, subject to adjustments, to the absolute value of the net\\nposition in each currency that is different from the settlement currency.\\nProposed Table 1 to \\xc2\\xa7.121\\nMarket Price Volatility Haircuts\\n(Haircut and risk weights in percent)\\nResidual maturity\\nSecurities issued by a\\nsovereign or an issuer\\ndescribed in\\nOther investment-grade\\nsecurities (percent)\\nPage 118 of 1089\\nDebt\\nsecurities\\nMain index\\nequities\\n(including\\nconvertible\\nbonds) and\\ngold\\nOther\\npublicly\\ntraded\\nequities\\nand\\nconvertible\\nbonds\\nMutual\\nfunds\\nCash on\\ndeposit\\nLess than or equal\\nto 1 year\\nGreater than 1\\nyear and less than\\nor equal to 3\\n118\\nyears\\nGreater than 3\\nyears and less\\nthan or equal to 5\\nyears\\nGreater than 5\\nyears and less\\nthan or equal to\\n10 years\\nGreater than 10\\nyears\\n\\xc2\\xa7___. 111(b)\\xc2\\xb9\\xc2\\xb98 (percent)\\nIssuer Issuer\\nrisk\\nrisk\\nweight weight\\nof\\nof 20\\nzero\\nor 50\\n1\\n0.5\\n2\\n4\\n3\\n6\\nIssuer\\nrisk\\nweight\\nof 100\\n15\\n15\\n15\\n20\\n30\\nExposures\\nother than\\nsecuritization\\nexposures\\nZero\\n2\\n4\\n6\\n12\\n20\\nSenior\\nsecuritization\\nexposures\\nrisk weight\\n< 100\\n12\\n24\\nwith\\nHighest haircut applicable to any security in which the fund can invest, unless\\nthe banking organization can apply the full look-through approach for equity\\ninvestments in funds in \\xc2\\xa7____.142(b), in which case the banking organization\\nmay use a weighted average of haircuts applicable to the securities held by the\\nfund.\\nThis category also would include public sector entities that are treated as sovereigns by the\\nnational supervisor.\\nPage 119 of 1089\\nOther\\nexposure\\n,119\\ntypes\\xc2\\xb919\\n30\\nThe proposed haircuts would strike a balance between simplicity and risk sensitivity\\nrelative to the supervisory haircuts in the current capital rule by introducing additional\\ngranularity with respect to residual maturity, which is a meaningful driver for distinguishing\\nbetween the market price volatility of different instruments, and by streamlining other aspects of\\nthe collateral haircut approach where the exposure\\'s risk weight figures less prominently in the\\ninstrument\\'s market price volatility, as described below.\\nThe proposal would apply haircuts based solely on residual maturity, rather than a\\ncombination of residual maturity and underlying risk weight as under the current capital rule for\\ninvestment grade debt securities other than sovereign debt securities. These haircuts are derived\\nfrom observed stress volatilities during 10-business day periods during the 2008 financial crisis.\\nDebt securities with longer maturities are subject to higher price volatility from future changes in\\nboth interest rates and the creditworthiness of the issuer.\\nBecause securitization exposures tend to be more volatile than corporate debt,\\xc2\\xb920 the\\nproposal would provide a distinct category of market price volatility haircuts for certain\\nsecuritization exposures consistent with the current capital rule. The proposal would distinguish\\nbetween non-senior and senior securitization exposures to enhance risk sensitivity. Since senior\\nsecuritization exposures absorb losses only after more junior securitization exposures, these\\nexposures have an added layer of security and different market price volatility. Therefore, the\\n119\\nIncludes senior securitization exposures with a risk weight greater than or equal to 100\\npercent and sovereign exposures with a risk weight greater than 100 percent.\\n120 See Basel Committee, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cStrengthening the resilience of the banking sector - consultative\\ndocument,\" December 2009; https://www.bis.org/publ/bcbs164.pdf.\\nPage 120 of 1089\\nproposal would only specify term-based haircuts for investment grade senior securitization\\nexposures that receive a risk weight of less than 100 percent under the securitization framework.\\nOther securitization exposures would receive the 30 percent market price volatility haircut\\napplicable to \"other\" exposure types.\\nThe proposal would require a banking organization to apply market price volatility\\nhaircuts of 20 percent for main index equities (including convertible bonds) and gold, 30 percent\\nfor other publicly traded equities and convertible bonds, and 30 percent for other exposure types.\\nEquities in a main index typically are more liquid than those that are not included in a main\\nindex, as investors may seek to replicate the index by purchasing the referenced equities or\\nengaging in derivative transactions involving the index or equities within the index. The lower\\nhaircuts for equities included in a main index under the proposal would reflect the higher\\nliquidity of those securities compared to other publicly traded equities or exposure types, which\\nwould generally help to reduce losses to banking organizations when liquidating those securities\\nduring stress conditions.\\nFor collateral in the form of mutual fund shares, the proposal would be consistent with\\nthe collateral haircut approach provided in the current capital rule in which a banking\\norganization would apply the highest haircut applicable to any security in which the fund can\\ninvest. The proposal also would include an alternative method available to a banking\\norganization if the mutual fund qualifies for the full look-through approach described in section\\nIII.E.1.c.ii. of this Supplementary Information. This alternative method would provide a more\\nrisk-sensitive calculation of the haircut on mutual fund shares collateral by using the weighted\\nPage 121 of 1089\\naverage of haircuts applicable to the instruments held by the mutual fund.\\xc2\\xb92\\xc2\\xb9 This aspect of the\\nproposal reflects the agencies\\' observation that, while certain mutual funds may be authorized to\\nhold a wide range of investments, the actual holdings of mutual funds are often more limited.\\nIn addition, the proposal would maintain the requirement for a banking organization to\\napply a market price volatility haircut of 30 percent to address the potential market price\\nvolatility for any instruments that the banking organization has lent, sold subject to repurchase,\\nor posted as collateral that is not of a type otherwise specified in Table 1.\\nQuestion 53: What are the advantages and disadvantages of allowing banking\\norganizations to apply the full look-through approach for certain collateral in the form of mutual\\nfund shares? What alternative approaches should the agencies consider for banking\\norganizations to determine the market price volatility haircuts for collateral in the form of\\nmutual fund shares?\\nIII.\\nMinimum haircut floors for certain eligible margin loans and repo-style\\ntransactions\\nThe proposed framework for minimum haircuts on non-centrally cleared securities\\nfinancing transactions would reflect the risk exposure of banking organizations to non-bank\\nfinancial entities that employ leverage and engage in maturity transformation but that are not\\nsubject to prudential regulation.\\n121 If the mutual fund qualifies for the full look-through approach described in section III.E.1.c.ii\\nof this Supplementary Information but would be treated as a market risk covered position as\\ndescribed in section III.H.3 of this Supplementary Information if the banking organization held\\nthe mutual fund directly, the banking organization is permitted to apply the alternative method to\\ncalculate the haircut.\\nPage 122 of 1089\\nThe absence of prudential regulation makes such entities more vulnerable to runs, leading\\nto an increase in the credit risk of these entities in the form of a greater risk of default in stress\\nperiods.\\xc2\\xb922 Episodes of non-bank financial entities\\' distress, such as the 2008 financial crisis,\\nhave highlighted banking organizations\\' exposure to non-bank financial entities through\\nsecurities financing transactions, which may give rise to credit and liquidity risks.\\nSecurities financing transactions may include repo-style transactions and eligible margin\\nloans. The motivation behind a specific securities financing transaction can be either to lend or\\nborrow cash, or to lend or borrow a security. Securities financing transactions can be used by a\\ncounterparty to achieve significant leverage \\xe2\\x80\\x93 for example, through transactions where the\\nprimary purpose is to finance a counterparty through the lending of cash \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and result in elevated\\ncounterparty credit risk.\\nThe proposal would require a banking organization to receive a minimum amount of\\ncollateral when undertaking certain repo-style transactions and eligible margin loans (in-scope\\ntransactions) with such entities (unregulated financial institutions). The application of haircut\\nfloors would determine the minimum amount of collateral exchanged. A banking organization\\nwould treat in-scope transactions with unregulated financial institutions that do not meet the\\nproposed haircut floors as repo-style transactions or eligible margin loans where the banking\\norganization did not receive any collateral from its counterparty. The proposed treatment is\\nintended to limit the build-up of excessive leverage outside the banking system and reduce the\\n123\\n122 See \"Strengthening Oversight and Regulation of Shadow Banking,\" Financial Stability Board,\\nAugust 2013 https://www.fsb.org/wp-content/uploads/r_130829b.pdf.\\n123 In this example, the banking organization would be permitted to calculate the exposure\\namount using the collateral haircut approach but would be required to exclude any collateral\\nreceived from the calculation. Alternatively, the banking organization could choose not to use\\nthe collateral haircut approach but to risk weight any on-balance sheet or off-balance sheet\\nportions of the exposure as demonstrated in the example below.\\nPage 123 of 1089\\ncyclicality of such leverage, thereby limiting risk to the lending banking organization and the\\nbanking system.\\nUnregulated financial institutions\\nConsistent with the definition in \\xc2\\xa7_ 2 of the current capital rule, the proposal would\\ndefine unregulated financial institution as a financial institution that is not a regulated financial\\ninstitution, including any financial institution that would meet the definition of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfinancial\\ninstitution\" under section \\xc2\\xa7.2 of the current capital rule but for the ownership interest\\nthresholds set forth in paragraph (4)(i) of that definition. Unregulated financial institutions would\\ninclude hedge funds and private equity firms. This definition would capture non-bank financial\\nentities that employ leverage and engage in maturity transformation but that are not subject to\\nprudential regulation.\\nA.\\nQuestion 54: What entities should be included or excluded from the scope of entities\\nsubject to the minimum haircut floors and why? For example, what would be the advantages and\\ndisadvantages of expanding the definition of entities that are scoped-in to include all\\ncounterparties, or all counterparties other than QCCPs? What impact would expanding the\\nscope of entities subject to the minimum haircut floors have on banking organizations\\' business\\nmodels, competitiveness, or ability to intermediate in funding markets and in U.S. Treasury\\nsecurities markets?\\nB.\\nIn-scope transactions\\nUnder the proposal, an in-scope transaction generally would include the following non-\\ncentrally cleared transactions: (1) an eligible margin loan or a repo-style transaction in which a\\nbanking organization lends cash to an unregulated financial institution in exchange for securities,\\nunless all of the securities are non-defaulted sovereign exposures, and (2) certain security-for-\\nPage 124 of 1089\\nsecurity repo-style transactions that are collateral upgrade transactions with an unregulated\\nfinancial institution. Under the proposal, a collateral upgrade transaction would include a\\ntransaction in which the banking organization lends one or more securities that, in aggregate, are\\nsubject to a lower haircut floor in Table 2 than the securities received from the unregulated\\nfinancial institution.\\nThe proposal would exempt the following types of transactions and netting sets of such\\ntransactions with unregulated financial institutions from the minimum haircut floor requirements:\\n(1) transactions in which an unregulated financial institution lends, sells subject to repurchase, or\\nposts as collateral securities to a banking organization in exchange for cash and the unregulated\\nfinancial institution reinvests the cash at the same or a shorter maturity than the original\\ntransaction with the banking organization; (2) collateral upgrade transactions in which the\\nunregulated financial institution is unable to re-hypothecate, or contractually agrees that it will\\nnot re-hypothecate, the securities it receives as collateral; or (3) transactions in which a banking\\norganization borrows securities from an unregulated financial institution for the purpose of\\nmeeting current or anticipated demand, such as for delivery obligations, customer demand, or\\nsegregation requirements, and not to provide financing to the unregulated financial institution.\\nFor transactions that are cash-collateralized in which an unregulated financial institution lends\\nsecurities to the banking organization, banking organizations could rely on representations made\\nby the unregulated financial institution as to whether the unregulated financial institution\\nreinvests the cash at the same or a shorter maturity than the maturity of the transaction. For\\ntransactions in which a banking organization is seeking to borrow securities from an unregulated\\nfinancial institution to meet a current or anticipated demand, banking organizations must\\nmaintain sufficient written documentation that such transactions are for the purpose of meeting a\\nPage 125 of 1089\\ncurrent or anticipated demand and not for providing financing to an unregulated financial\\ninstitution. The proposal would exclude these in-scope transactions from the minimum haircut\\nfloors as these transactions do not pose the same credit and liquidity risks as other in-scope\\ntransactions and serve as important liquidity and intermediation services provided by banking\\norganizations.\\nQuestion 55: What alternative definitions of \"in-scope transactions\" should the agencies\\nconsider? For example, what would be the pros and cons of an expanded definition of \"in-scope\\ntransactions\" to include all eligible margin loan or repo-style transactions in which a banking\\norganization lends cash, including those involving sovereign exposures as collateral? How\\nwould the inclusion of sovereign exposures affect the market for those securities? What, if any,\\nadditional factors should the agencies consider concerning this alternative definition?\\nQuestion 56: What, if any, difficulties would banking organizations have in identifying\\ntransactions that would be exempt from the minimum haircut floor?\\nQuestion 57: What, if any, operational burdens would be imposed by the proposal to\\nrequire banking organizations to maintain sufficient written documentation to exempt\\ntransactions with an unregulated financial institution where the banking organization is seeking\\nto borrow securities from an unregulated financial institution to meet a current or anticipated\\ndemand?\\nC. Application of the minimum haircut floors\\nFor in-scope transactions, the proposal would establish minimum haircut floors that\\nwould be applied on a single-transaction or a portfolio basis depending on whether the in-scope\\ntransaction is part of a netting set. The proposed haircut floors are derived from observed\\nhistorical price volatilities as well as existing market and central bank haircut conventions. If the\\nPage 126 of 1089\\nin-scope transaction is a single transaction, then the banking organization would apply the\\ncorresponding single-transaction haircut floor. If the in-scope transaction is part of a netting set,\\nthe banking organization would apply a portfolio-based floor to the entire netting set. In-scope\\ntransactions that do not meet the applicable minimum haircut floor would be treated as\\nuncollateralized exposures.\\n124\\nThe minimum haircut floors are intended to reflect the minimum amount of collateral\\nbanking organizations should receive when undertaking in-scope transactions with unregulated\\nfinancial institutions. Banking organizations should require an appropriate amount of collateral\\nto be provided to account for the risks of the transaction and counterparty. Figure 1 provides a\\nsummary of the process for determining whether an in-scope transaction meets the applicable\\nminimum haircut floor.\\nFigure 1.

If H is less\\nthan f, then the banking organization may not recognize the risk-mitigating effects of any\\nfinancial collateral that secures the exposure.\\nFor a single cash-lent-for-security in-scope transaction, H would be defined as the ratio\\nof the fair value of financial collateral borrowed, purchased subject to resale, or taken as\\ncollateral from the counterparty to the fair value of cash lent, minus one, and f would be the\\ncorresponding haircut applicable to the collateral in Table 2. For example, for an in-scope\\ntransaction in which a banking organization lends $100 in cash to an unregulated financial\\ninstitution and receives $102 in investment-grade corporate bonds with a residual maturity of 10\\nyears as collateral, the haircut would be calculated as H = 1 = 2 percent. The single-\\ntransaction haircut floor for an investment grade corporate bond with a residual maturity of 10\\nyears or less under Table 2 would be f = 3 percent. Since the haircut is less than the single-\\n102\\n100\\nPage 128 of 1089\\ntransaction haircut floor (H = 2 percent < 3 percent = f), the proposal would not allow the\\nbanking organization to recognize the risk-mitigating benefits of the collateral and would require\\nthe banking organization to calculate the exposure amount of its repo-style transaction or eligible\\nmargin loan as if it had not received any collateral from its counterparty.\\nFor a single security-for-security repo-style transaction, H would be defined as the ratio\\nof the fair value of financial collateral borrowed, purchased subject to resale, or taken as\\ncollateral from the counterparty (B) relative to the fair value of the financial collateral the\\nbanking organization has lent, sold subject to repurchase, or posted as collateral to the\\ncounterparty (L), minus one. The single-transaction haircut floor (f) of the transaction would\\nincorporate the corresponding haircut applicable to the collateral received (f) and collateral lent\\n(f) in Table 2. The single-transaction haircut floor for the two types of collateral would be\\ncomputed as follows:\\n\\xc6\\x92 = ((1 + (0) / (1+1)) - 1\\nThe single transaction floor then would be compared to the haircut of the transaction,\\ndetermined as follows:\\nH=CB-1\\nwhere CB denotes the fair value of collateral received and CL the fair value of collateral\\nlent. For example, for a securities lending transaction in which a banking organization lends\\n$100 in investment grade corporate bonds with a residual maturity of 10 years (which correspond\\nto a haircut floor of 3 percent) and receives $102 in main index equity securities (which\\ncorrespond to a haircut floor of 6 percent) as collateral, the haircut would be H\\n=\\n=\\n2 percent. The single-transaction haircut floor would be f =\\n1+6%\\n1+3%\\n102\\n100\\n1 =\\n-\\n- 1 = 2.9126 percent. Since\\nPage 129 of 1089\\nthe haircut is less than the single-transaction haircut floor (H = 2 percent < 2.9126 percent\\nf), the banking organization would not be able to recognize the risk-mitigating benefits of the\\ncollateral received and would be required to calculate the exposure amount of its repo-style\\ntransaction or eligible margin loan as if it had not received any collateral from its counterparty.\\nFor a netting set of in-scope transactions, the haircut floor of the netting set would be\\ncomputed as follows:\\nf\\xe2\\x82\\x82)) (\\xce\\xa3(CB /(1+\\n*Portfolio = ((ECC, /(L + f.)))/(ECB ((1 + fn)))\\n\\xc2\\xb7 1\\n\\xce\\xa3 CL\\n\\xce\\xa3 CB\\nas:\\nIn the above formula, C\\xe2\\x82\\x81 would be the fair value of the net position in each security or in\\ncash that is net lent, sold subject to repurchase, or posted as collateral to the counterparty; CB is\\nthe fair value of the net position that is net borrowed, purchased subject to resale, or taken as\\ncollateral from the counterparty; and \\xc6\\x92\\xe2\\x82\\x81 and \\xc6\\x92 would be the haircut floors for the securities or\\ncash, as applicable, that are net lent and net borrowed, respectively. \\xc2\\xb925 This calculation would be\\nthe weighted average haircut floor of the portfolio. The portfolio haircut H would be calculated\\n= (\\xce\\xa3 CB / EC\\xe2\\x82\\x81) - 1\\nThe portfolio would satisfy the minimum haircut floor requirement where the following\\ncondition is satisfied:\\n=\\nH =\\nH> fportfolio\\n125\\nFor a given security or cash, a banking organization may collect the security or cash in one\\ntransaction and post it in another. Thus, at the portfolio level, the banking organization may, after\\nnetting across all transactions in the same portfolio, be either collecting the security or cash (that\\nis, net borrowed) or posting the security or cash (that is, net lent).\\nPage 130 of 1089\\nIf the portfolio does not satisfy the minimum haircut floor, the banking organization\\nwould not be able to recognize the risk-mitigating benefits of the collateral received.\\nIn the following example, there are two in-scope repo-style transactions that are in the\\nsame netting set: (1) a reverse repo transaction in which a banking organization lends $100 in\\ncash to an unregulated financial institution and receives $102 in investment grade corporate\\nbonds with a residual maturity of 10 years (which correspond to a haircut floor of 3 percent) as\\ncollateral; and (2) a securities lending transaction in which a banking organization lends $100 of\\ndifferent investment grade corporate bonds also with a residual maturity of 10 years and receives\\n$104 in main index equity securities (which correspond to a haircut floor of 6 percent) as\\ncollateral. For this set of in-scope repo-style transactions, the portfolio haircut would be H =\\n1 = 3 percent.

For this set of in-scope repo-style\\n\\xc2\\xb7 1 = 1.5 percent and the portfolio\\ntransactions, the portfolio haircut would be H =\\n101+102\\n100+100\\nhaircut floor would be: fportfolio\\n=\\n100\\n100\\n(1+0%) (1+3%)\\n+\\n100+100\\n(101/(1+3%)+102/(1+6%)`\\n101+102\\n1 =\\n=\\n2.9642 percent. Since the portfolio haircut is less than the portfolio haircut floor (H =\\n1.5 percent < 2.9642 percent = fportfolio), the banking organization would not be able to\\nrecognize the risk-mitigating benefits of the collateral received.\\nInstead, the banking organization would be required to separately risk-weight the on-\\nbalance sheet and off-balance sheet portion of each individual transaction. In this example,\\nassuming that both individual transactions are treated as secured borrowings instead of sales\\nunder GAAP, the first transaction in which a banking organization lends $100 in cash to an\\nunregulated financial institution and receives $101 in investment grade corporate bonds would\\nPage 132 of 1089\\nresult in an on-balance sheet receivable of $100.126 If the second transaction is a securities\\nlending transaction from the perspective of the banking organization and the banking\\norganization is permitted to sell or repledge the equity securities, the transaction results in an\\nincrease in the banking organization\\'s balance sheet of $102 for the equity securities received\\nfrom the counterparty. The banking organization would be required to apply a 100 percent credit\\nconversion factor (CCF) to the off-balance sheet exposure to its counterparty for the return of the\\ninvestment grade corporate bonds. In this case, the off-balance sheet exposure to the\\ncounterparty would be the $100 of lent investment grade corporate bonds.\\xc2\\xb927 The total exposure\\namount for the two transactions would be ($100 receivable + $102 equity exposure + $100 off-\\nbalance sheet exposure) = $302. If the banking organization is not permitted to sell or repledge\\nthe equity securities in the second transaction, or if that transaction is a securities borrowing\\ntransaction from the perspective of the banking organization, the equity securities received by the\\nbanking organization would not be recognized on the banking organization\\'s balance sheet. \\xc2\\xb928\\nThe banking organization would still be required to apply a 100 percent CCF to the off-balance\\nsheet exposure to its counterparty, so the total exposure amount would be ($100 receivable +\\n$100 off-balance sheet exposure) = $200.\\xc2\\xb9\\xc2\\xb3\\n129\\n130\\n126 The transaction would also result in credit (reduction) of $100 cash, but this would have no\\nimpact on the banking organization\\'s risk-weighted assets as cash is assigned a 0 percent risk\\nweight under section ____.111.\\n127\\nSee proposed section ____.112(b)(5)(iv).\\n128 If the transaction is a securities borrowing transaction from the perspective of the banking\\norganization, and if the equity securities received are sold or if the counterparty defaults, the\\nbanking organization would be required to record an obligation to return the securities.\\n129 See proposed section_.112(b)(5)(v)\\n130\\nIn all cases, the $100 of investment grade corporate bonds the banking organization has lent\\nwould continue to remain on the banking organization\\'s balance sheet and the banking\\norganization would continue to maintain risk-based capital against these bonds.\\nPage 133 of 1089\\nQuestion 58: What alternative minimum haircut floors should the agencies consider and\\nwhy? What would be the advantages and disadvantages of setting the minimum haircuts at a\\nhigher level, such as at the proposed market price volatility haircuts used for recognition of\\ncollateral for eligible margin loans and repo-style transactions, or at levels between the\\nproposed minimum haircut floors and the proposed market price volatility haircuts?\\nQuestion 59: Where a banking organization has exchanged multiple securities for\\nmultiple other securities under a QMNA with an unregulated financial institution, what would be\\nthe costs and benefits of providing banking organizations the flexibility to apply a single-\\ntransaction haircut floor on a transaction-by-transaction basis for in-scope transactions within\\nthe netting set, rather than applying a portfolio-based floor? Under this approach, each in-scope\\ntransaction within a netting set would be evaluated separately. Banking organizations would be\\npermitted to recognize the risk-mitigation benefits of collateral for individual transactions that\\nmeet the single-transaction haircut floor, even if the netting set did not meet the portfolio-based\\nfloor.\\nQuestion 60: How can the proposed formulas used for determining whether an in-scope\\ntransaction or in-scope set of transactions breaches the minimum haircut floors be improved or\\nfurther clarified?\\nQuestion 61: What are the advantages and disadvantages of the proposed approach to\\nminimum collateral haircuts for in-scope transactions with unregulated financial institutions?\\nHow might the proposal change the behavior of banking organizations and their counterparties,\\nincluding changes in funding practices and potential migration of funding transactions to other\\ncounterparties? Commenters are encouraged to provide data and supporting analysis.\\nD. Securitization framework\\nPage 134 of 1089\\nThe securitization framework is designed to provide the capital requirement for\\nexposures that involve the tranching of credit risk of one or more underlying financial exposures.\\nThe risk and complexity posed by securitizations differ relative to direct exposure to the\\nunderlying assets in the securitization because the credit risk of those assets is divided into\\ndifferent levels of loss prioritization using a wide range of structural mechanisms.131 The\\nperformance of a securitization depends not only on the structure, but also on the performance of\\nthe underlying assets and certain parties to the securitization structure, including the asset\\nservicer and any liquidity facility provider. The involvement of these parties makes securitization\\nexposures susceptible to additional risks as compared to direct credit exposures.\\nThe proposed securitization framework would draw on many features of the framework\\nin subpart E of the current capital rule with the following modifications: (1) additional\\noperational requirements for synthetic securitizations; (2) a modified treatment for\\nresecuritizations that meet the operational requirements; (3) a new securitization standardized\\napproach (SEC-SA), as a replacement to the supervisory formula approach and standardized\\nsupervisory formula approach (SSFA), which includes, relative to the SSFA, modified\\ndefinitions of attachment point and detachment point, a modified definition of the W parameter,\\nmodifications to the definition of KG, a higher p-factor, a lower risk-weight floor for\\nsecuritization exposures that are not resecuritization exposures, and a higher risk-weight floor for\\nresecuritization exposures; (4) a prohibition on using the securitization framework for nth-to-\\n131 To segment a reference portfolio into different levels of risks for different investors, the\\nsecuritization process divides the reference portfolio into different slices, called tranches, which\\nreceive cash flows or absorb losses based on a predetermined order of priority. This payment\\nstructure is known as the \"cash flow waterfall,\" or simply the \"waterfall.\" The waterfall schedule\\nprioritizes the manner in which interest or principal payments from the reference portfolio must\\nbe allocated, creating different risk-return profiles for each tranche.\\nPage 135 of 1089\\ndefault credit derivatives; (5) a new treatment for derivative contracts that do not provide credit\\nenhancement; (6) a modified treatment for overlapping exposures; (7) new maximum capital\\nrequirements and eligibility criteria for certain senior securitization exposures (the \"look-through\\napproach\"); (8) a modification to the treatment for credit-enhancing interest only strips (CEIOs);\\nand (9) a new framework for non-performing loan (NPL) securitizations. \\xc2\\xb9\\n132\\n1. Operational requirements\\nThe proposed operational requirements would be consistent with the operational\\nrequirements in subpart E of the current capital rule, with three exceptions as described below. In\\naddition, for resecuritization exposures that meet the operational requirements, the proposal\\nwould eliminate the option for banking organizations to treat the exposures as if they had not\\nbeen securitized.\\na. Early amortization provisions\\nEarly amortization provisions cause investors in securitization exposures to be repaid\\nbefore the original stated maturity when certain conditions are triggered. For example, many\\nsecuritizations of revolving credit facilities, most commonly credit-card receivable\\nsecuritizations, contain provisions that require the securitization to be wound down and investors\\nrepaid on an accelerated basis if excess spread falls below a certain threshold. This decrease in\\nexcess spread would typically be caused by credit deterioration in the underlying exposures.\\nSuch provisions can expose the originating banking organization to increased credit and liquidity\\nrisk and potentially increased capital requirements after the early amortization is triggered as the\\nbanking organization could be obligated to fund the borrowers\\' future draws on the revolving\\n132 The proposal generally would use the same approaches to determine the exposure amount of\\nsecuritization exposures.\\nPage 136 of 1089\\nlines of credit. In such an instance, the originating banking organization may have to either find a\\nnew funding source, whether internal or external, to cover the new draws or reduce borrowers\\'\\ncredit line availability.\\nThe proposal would expand the applicability of the operational requirements regarding\\nearly amortization provisions to synthetic securitizations, similar to their application to\\ntraditional securitizations under subpart D of the current capital rule. Under \\xc2\\xa7___. 2 of the current\\ncapital rule, an early amortization provision means a provision in the documentation governing a\\nsecuritization that, when triggered, causes investors in the securitization exposure to be repaid\\nbefore the original stated maturity of the securitization exposure, with certain exceptions.\\nUnder the proposal, if a synthetic securitization includes an early amortization provision and\\nreferences one or more underlying exposures in which the borrower is permitted to vary the\\ndrawn amount within an agreed limit under a line of credit, the banking organization would be\\nrequired to hold risk-based capital against the underlying exposures as if they had not been\\nsynthetically securitized.\\nQuestion 62: What, if any, additional exceptions to the early amortization provision\\ndefinition should the agencies consider and why, provided such exceptions would not incentivize\\na banking organization to provide implicit support to a securitization exposure?\\nb. Synthetic excess spread\\n133\\n133\\nThe exceptions to the current definition of early amortization provision are a provision that:\\n(1) is triggered solely by events not directly related to the performance of the underlying\\nexposures or the originating banking organization (such as material changes in tax laws or\\nregulations); or (2) leaves investors fully exposed to future draws by borrowers on the underlying\\nexposures even after the provision is triggered.\\nPage 137 of 1089\\nThe proposal would prohibit an originating banking organization from recognizing the\\nrisk-mitigating benefits of a synthetic securitization that includes synthetic excess spread.\\nSynthetic excess spread would be defined in the proposal as any contractual provision in a\\nsynthetic securitization that is designed to absorb losses prior to any of the tranches of the\\nsecuritization structure. Synthetic excess spread is a form of credit enhancement provided by the\\noriginating banking organization to the investors in the synthetic securitization; therefore, the\\noriginating banking organization should maintain capital against the credit exposure represented\\nby the synthetic excess spread. However, a risk-based capital requirement for synthetic excess\\nspread may not be determinable with sufficient precision to promote comparability across\\nbanking organizations because the amount of synthetic excess spread made available to investors\\nin the synthetic securitization would depend upon the maturity of the underlying assets, which\\nitself depends on whether any of the underlying exposures have defaulted or prepaid. In\\nparticular, the total amount of synthetic excess spread made available at inception to investors\\nover the life of the transaction may not be known ex ante, as the outstanding balance of the\\nsecuritization in future years is unknown. Therefore, if a synthetic securitization structure\\nincludes synthetic excess spread, the banking organization would be required under the proposal\\nto maintain capital against all the underlying exposures as if they had not been synthetically\\nsecuritized.\\nQuestion 63: What clarifications or modifications should the agencies consider for the\\nabove proposed definition of synthetic excess spread and why?\\nQuestion 64: What are the advantages and disadvantages of the proposed treatment of\\nsynthetic securitizations with synthetic excess spread? If the agencies were to permit originating\\nbanking organizations to recognize the credit risk-mitigation benefits of securitizations with\\nPage 138 of 1089\\nsynthetic excess spread, how should the exposure amount of the synthetic excess spread be\\ncalculated, and what would be the appropriate capital requirement for synthetic excess spread?\\nc. Minimum payment threshold\\nUnder the proposal, the operational requirements for synthetic securitizations would\\ninclude a new requirement that any applicable minimum payment threshold for the credit risk\\nmitigant be consistent with standard market practice. A minimum payment threshold is a\\ncontractual minimum amount that must be delinquent before a credit event is deemed to have\\noccurred. The proposed minimum payment threshold criterion is intended to prohibit an\\noriginating banking organization from recognizing the capital reducing benefits of a synthetic\\nsecuritization whose minimum payment threshold is so large that it allows for material losses to\\noccur without triggering the credit protection acquired by the protection purchaser, as such\\nprovisions would interfere with an effective transfer of credit risk.\\nQuestion 65: What are the benefits and drawbacks of the proposed minimum payment\\nthreshold criterion? What, if any, additional criteria or clarifications should the agencies\\nconsider and why?\\nd. Resecuritization exposures\\nFor a resecuritization that is a traditional securitization, if the operational requirements\\nhave been met, an originating banking organization would be required to exclude the transferred\\nexposures from the calculation of its risk-weighted assets and maintain risk-based capital against\\nany credit risk it retains in connection with the resecuritization. Unlike in the case of a\\nsecuritization exposure that is not a resecuritization, the proposal would not allow a banking\\norganization the option to elect to treat a resecuritization as if the underlying exposures had not\\nbeen re-securitized. While a securitization of non-securitized assets can be used to diversify or\\nPage 139 of 1089\\ntransfer credit risk of those exposures, a resecuritization might not offer similar risk reduction or\\ndiversification benefits, particularly if the underlying exposures reflect similar high-risk tranches\\nof other securitizations. Therefore, these resecuritization exposures warrant a higher regulatory\\ncapital requirement than that applicable to the underlying exposures.\\nSimilarly, for a resecuritization that is a synthetic securitization, if the operational\\nrequirements have been met, an originating banking organization would be required to recognize\\nfor risk-based capital purposes the use of a credit risk mitigant to hedge the underlying exposures\\nand must hold capital against any credit risk of the exposures it retains in connection with the\\nsynthetic securitization.\\n2. Securitization standardized approach (SEC-SA)\\nUnder the proposal, a banking organization would determine the capital requirements for\\nmost securitization exposures under the SEC-SA, which is substantively similar to the SSFA in\\nthe current capital rule except for certain changes as discussed below. Under the SEC-SA, a\\nbanking organization would determine the risk weight for a securitization exposure based on the\\nrisk weight of the underlying assets, with adjustments to reflect (1) delinquencies in such assets,\\n(2) the securitization exposure\\'s subordination level in the allocation of losses, and (3) the\\nheightened correlation and additional risks inherent in securitizations relative to direct credit\\nexposures.\\nTo calculate the risk weight for a securitization exposure using the SEC-SA, a banking\\norganization must have accurate information on the parameters used in the SEC-SA calculation.\\nIf the banking organization cannot, or chooses not to, apply the SEC-SA, the banking\\norganization would be required to apply a 1,250 percent risk weight to the exposure.\\na. Definition of attachment point and detachment point\\nPage 140 of 1089\\nUnder the current capital rule, the attachment point (parameter A) of a securitization\\nexposure equals the ratio of the current dollar amount of underlying exposures that are\\nsubordinated to the exposure of the banking organization to the current dollar amount of\\nunderlying exposures. Any reserve account funded by the accumulated cash flows from the\\nunderlying exposures that is subordinated to the banking organization\\'s securitization exposure\\nmay be included in the calculation of parameter A to the extent that cash is present in the\\naccount. The calculation in the current capital rule does not permit a banking organization to\\nrecognize noncash assets in a reserve account in the calculation of parameter A. In contrast, the\\nproposal would permit a banking organization to recognize all assets, cash or noncash, that are\\nincluded in a reserve account in the calculation of parameter A. However, a banking organization\\nwould not be allowed to include interest rate derivative contracts and exchange rate derivative\\ncontracts, or the cash collateral accounts related to these instruments, in the calculation of\\nparameters A and D. The agencies are proposing this treatment because assets held in a funded\\nreserve account, whether cash or noncash, can provide credit enhancement to a securitization\\nexposure, whereas interest rate and foreign exchange derivatives (and any cash collateral held\\nagainst these derivatives) do not.\\n134\\nThe proposal would modify the definition of attachment point so that it refers to the\\noutstanding balance of the underlying assets in the pool rather than the current dollar value of the\\nunderlying exposures. By referencing the outstanding balance of the underlying assets instead of\\nthe current dollar amount of the underlying exposures, the revised definition would clarify that a\\n134 For example, if a securitization SPE has assets denominated in U.S. Dollars and liabilities\\ndenominated in Euros, and if the securitization SPE executes a USD-EUR foreign exchange\\nswap, the swap hedges the foreign exchange risk between the SPE\\'s assets and liabilities but\\ndoes not provide credit enhancement to any of the tranches of the securitization.\\nPage 141 of 1089\\nbanking organization may recognize a nonrefundable purchase price discount \\xc2\\xb935 when\\ncalculating the attachment point of a securitization exposure. A similar modification would be\\nmade to the definition of detachment point. 136\\nb. Definition of W parameter\\nUnder the current capital rule, parameter W, which is expressed as a decimal value\\nbetween zero and one, reflects the proportion of underlying exposures that are not performing or\\nare delinquent, according to criteria outlined in the rule. The proposal would apply a similar\\ndefinition of parameter W for subpart E, but clarify that for resecuritization exposures, any\\nunderlying exposure that is a securitization exposure would only be included in the denominator\\nof the ratio and would be excluded from the numerator of the ratio. That is, for resecuritization\\nexposures, parameter W would be the ratio of the sum of the outstanding balance of any\\nunderlying exposures of the securitization that meet any of the criteria in paragraphs\\n___.133(b)(1)(i) through (vi) of the proposal that are not securitization exposures to the\\noutstanding balance of all underlying exposures. Underlying securitization exposures need not be\\nincluded in the numerator of parameter W because the risk weight of the underlying\\nsecuritization exposure as calculated by the SEC-SA already reflects the impact of any\\n135\\nThe proposal would define nonrefundable purchase price discount to mean the difference\\nbetween the initial outstanding balance of the exposures in the underlying pool and the price at\\nwhich these exposures are sold by the originator to the securitization SPE, when neither\\noriginator nor the original lender are reimbursed for this difference. In cases where the originator\\nunderwrites tranches of a NPL securitization for subsequent sale, the NRPPD may include the\\ndifferences between the notional amount of the tranches and the price at which these tranches are\\nfirst sold to unrelated third parties. For any given piece of a securitization tranche, only its initial\\nsale from the originator to investors is taken into account in the determination of NRPPD. The\\npurchase prices of subsequent re-sales are not considered. See proposed definition in section\\n__.101.\\n136\\nFor the sake of consistency, the proposal would also use the term \\xe2\\x80\\x9coutstanding balance\" in the\\ncalculation of W and KG.\\nPage 142 of 1089\\ndelinquent or otherwise nonperforming loans within the underlying securitization exposure. For\\nexample, if a resecuritization with a notional amount of $10 million includes underlying\\nsecuritization exposures with a notional amount of $5 million and underlying non-securitization\\nexposures with a notional amount of $5 million, and if $500,000 of the non-securitization\\nexposures are delinquent, the numerator for the W parameter would be $500,000 while the\\ndenominator for the W parameter would be $10 million. This would be true regardless of the\\ndelinquency status of any of the securitization exposures.\\nc. Delinquency-adjusted (KA) and non-adjusted (KG) weighted-average capital requirement\\nof the underlying exposures\\nUnder the proposal, K\\xc4\\x84 would reflect the delinquency-adjusted, weighted-average capital\\nrequirement of the underlying exposures and would be a function of KG and W. Under this\\napproach, in order to calculate parameter W, and thus K\\xc3\\x83, the banking organization must know\\nthe delinquency status of all underlying exposures in the securitization. KG would equal the\\nweighted average total capital requirement of the underlying exposures (with the outstanding\\nbalance used as the weight for each exposure), calculated using the risk weights according to\\nsubpart E of the proposed rule.\\nThe agencies are proposing two modifications to the definition of KG for SEC-SA\\ncompared to the current KG as used in the SSFA. First, for interest rate derivative contracts and\\nexchange rate derivative contracts, the positive current exposure times the risk weight of the\\ncounterparty multiplied by 0.08 would be included in the numerator of KG but excluded from the\\ndenominator of K\\xc4\\xa0. If amounts related to interest rate and exchange rate derivative contracts\\nwere included in both the numerator and denominator of KG, these contracts could reduce the\\ncapital requirement of securitization exposures even though interest rate and exchange rate\\nPage 143 of 1089\\nderivative contracts do not provide any credit enhancement to a securitization. Second, if a\\nbanking organization transfers credit risk via a synthetic securitization to a securitization SPE\\nand if the securitization SPE issues funded obligations to investors, the banking organization\\nwould include the total capital requirement (exposure amount multiplied by risk weight\\nmultiplied by 0.08) of any collateral held by the securitization SPE in the numerator of KG. The\\ndenominator of KG is calculated without recognition of the collateral. This ensures that if\\ncollateral held at the SPE is invested in credit-sensitive assets, the credit risk associated with\\nthose assets will be included in the banking organization\\'s capital calculation. Consistent with\\nsubpart D of the current capital rule, under the proposal, the value of KG for a resecuritization\\nexposure would equal the weighted average of two distinct K\\xc4\\xa0 values, one for the underlying\\nsecuritization (which equals the capital requirement calculated using the SEC-SA), the other for\\nthe underlying exposures (which equals the weighted average capital requirement of the\\nunderlying exposures).\\nQuestion 66: Recognizing that banking organizations may not always know the\\ndelinquency status of all underlying exposures, what would be the benefits and drawbacks of\\nallowing a banking organization to use the SEC-SA if the banking organization knows the\\ndelinquency status for most, but not all, of the underlying exposures? For example, if the banking\\norganization knew the delinquency status of 95 percent of the exposures, it could (1) split the\\nunderlying exposures into two subpools, (2) calculate a weighted average of the KA of the\\nsubpool comprising the underlying exposures for which the delinquency status is known, (3)\\nA\\nassign a value of 1 for K\\xc3\\xa5 of the other subpool comprising exposures for which the delinquency\\nstatus is unknown, and (4) assign a K\\xe2\\x82\\x81 for the entire pool equal to the weighted average of the\\nKA for each subpool. What other approaches should the agencies consider and why?\\nPage 144 of 1089\\nd. Supervisory calibration parameter (Supervisory parameter p)\\nUnder the proposal, a banking organization would apply a supervisory parameter p of 1.0\\nto securitization exposures that are not resecuritization exposures and a supervisory parameter p\\nof 1.5 to resecuritization exposures. The proposed increase to the supervisory parameter p for\\nsecuritizations that are not resecuritization exposures from 0.5 to 1.0 would help to ensure that\\nthe framework produces appropriately conservative risk-based capital requirements when\\ncombined with the reduced risk weights applicable to certain underlying assets under the\\nproposal that would be reflected in lower values of KG and the proposed reduction in the risk-\\nweight floor under SEC-SA for securitization exposures that are not resecuritization\\nexposures. 137\\ne. Supervisory risk-weight floors\\nThe SEC-SA would require banking organizations to apply a risk weight floor to all\\nsecuritization exposures. The SEC-SA is based on assumptions and the risk weight floor ensures\\na minimum level of capital is held to account for modelling risks and correlation risks. 138 The\\nproposal would apply a risk weight floor of 15 percent for securitization exposures that are not\\nresecuritization exposures. The 15 percent risk weight floor is most relevant for more senior\\nsecuritization exposures. While junior tranches can absorb a significant amount of credit risk,\\nsenior tranches are still exposed to some amount of credit risk on the underlying exposures.\\nTherefore, a minimum prudential capital requirement continues to be appropriate in the\\nsecuritization context.\\n137 See sections III.C.2 and III.D.2.d of this Supplementary Information for a more detailed\\ndiscussion of the reduced risk weights applicable to certain underlying assets and the risk-weight\\nfloor, respectively.\\n138 Default correlation is the likelihood that two or more exposures will default at the same time.\\nPage 145 of 1089\\nFor resecuritization exposures, the proposed SEC-SA approach would require banking\\norganizations to apply a risk-weight floor of at least 100 percent. The proposed 100 percent\\nsupervisory risk-weight floor for resecuritization exposures is intended to capture the greater\\ncomplexity of such exposures and heightened correlation risks inherent in the underlying\\nsecuritization exposures. 139\\nThe proposal would also apply a minimum risk weight of 100 percent to NPL\\nsecuritization exposures. Compared to other securitizations, the performance of NPL\\nsecuritizations depends more heavily on the servicer\\'s ability to generate cashflows from the\\nworkout of the underlying exposures, typically through renegotiation of the defaulted loans with\\nthe borrower or enforcement against the collateral. These idiosyncratic risks associated with NPL\\nsecuritizations merit a higher minimum risk weight.\\n3. Exceptions to the SEC-SA risk-based capital treatment for securitization\\nexposures\\nSecuritization exposures sometimes contain unique features that, if not accounted for,\\ncould produce inconsistent outcomes under the SEC-SA or in some cases make the calculation of\\nthe risk weight inoperable. Thus, notwithstanding the general application of SEC-SA, the\\nproposal would include additional approaches to account for certain types of securitization\\n139\\nIn a typical securitization exposure that is not a resecuritization, each underlying exposure is\\nsubject to idiosyncratic default risks (for example, the employment status of each obligor) which\\nmay exhibit lower relative default correlation. In a resecuritization exposure, the underlying\\nexposures, which are typically tranches of securitizations, usually have credit enhancement from\\nmore junior tranches that protects against many idiosyncratic risks. Systematic risks are more\\nlikely to generate defaults in the underlying exposures of resecuritizations than idiosyncratic\\nrisks, but systematic risks are also much more correlated; therefore, resecuritizations typically\\nhave higher default correlations than other types of securitizations.\\nPage 146 of 1089\\nexposures, which would more appropriately align the capital requirement with the risk of the\\nexposure.\\na. Nth-to-default credit derivatives\\nUnder the current capital rule, a banking organization that has purchased credit protection\\nin the form of an nth-to-default credit derivative is permitted to recognize the risk mitigating\\nbenefits of that derivative. The proposal would not permit banking organizations to recognize\\nany risk-mitigating benefit for nth-to-default credit derivatives in which the banking organization\\nis the protection purchaser under either the proposed credit risk mitigation framework or under\\nthe proposed securitization framework. Purchased credit protection through nth-to-default\\nderivatives often does not correlate with the hedged exposure which inhibits the risk mitigating\\nbenefits of the instrument.\\nFor nth-to-default credit derivatives in which the banking organization is the protection\\nprovider, the proposal would prohibit use of the securitization framework and instead would\\nrequire banking organizations to calculate the risk-weighted asset amount by multiplying the\\naggregate risk weights of the assets included in the basket up to a maximum of 1,250 percent by\\nthe notional amount of the protection provided by the credit derivative. In aggregating the risk\\nweights, the (n-1) assets with the lowest risk weight may be excluded from the calculation. This\\napproach would require banking organizations to maintain capital based on the risk\\ncharacteristics of all the underlying assets in the basket on which it is providing protection, while\\naccounting for the fact that the banking organization is not required to make a payment unless\\n\"n\" names in the basket default.\\nb. Derivative contracts that do not provide credit enhancements\\nPage 147 of 1089\\nThe proposal would provide a new treatment for certain interest rate or foreign exchange\\nderivative contracts that qualify as securitization exposures. Some securitizations either make\\npayments to investors in a different currency from the underlying exposures or make fixed\\npayments to investors when the cash flows received on the securitized assets are linked to a\\nfloating interest rate. To neutralize these foreign exchange or interest rate risks, the securitization\\nSPE may enter into a derivative contract that mirrors the currency or interest rate mismatch\\nbetween the exposures and the tranches. Cash flows required to be made to the derivative\\ncounterparty tend to have a senior claim to the principal and interest payment of the collateral,\\nand therefore tend not to provide credit enhancement.\\nThe proposal would require a banking organization that acts as a counterparty to these\\ntypes of interest rate and foreign exchange derivatives to set the risk weight on such derivatives\\nequal to the risk weight calculated under the SEC-SA for a securitization exposure that is pari\\npassu to the derivative contract or, if such an exposure does not exist, the risk weight of the next\\nsubordinated tranche of the securitization exposure. A banking organization may otherwise not\\nbe able to calculate a risk weight for these derivative contracts using the SEC-SA because the\\nattachment and detachment points under the proposed formula could equal one another,\\nrendering the formula inoperable. The proposed treatment is intended to appropriately reflect\\nhow the credit risk associated with these derivative contracts would be commensurate with or\\nless than the credit risk associated with a pari passu tranche or the next subordinated tranche of a\\nsecuritization exposure.\\nThe current capital rule permits banking organizations to assign a risk-weighted asset\\namount for certain derivative contracts that are securitization exposures equal to the exposure\\namount of the derivative contract (i.e., a risk weight of 100 percent). The proposal would\\nPage 148 of 1089\\neliminate this option. The approaches for derivative contracts described in sections III.C.4. of\\nthis Supplementary Information (including the treatment for derivative contracts that do not\\nprovide credit enhancement described above) are more risk-sensitive and reflective of the risks\\nthan a flat 100 percent risk weight.\\ni. Overlapping exposures\\nThe proposal would introduce new provisions for overlapping exposures. \\xc2\\xb94\\xe2\\x81\\xb0 First, the\\nproposal would allow a banking organization to treat two non-overlapping securitization\\nexposures as overlapping to the degree that the banking organization assumes that obligations\\nwith respect to one of the exposures covers obligations with respect to the other exposure. For\\nexample, if a banking organization provides a full liquidity facility to an ABCP program that is\\nnot contractually required to fund defaulted assets and the banking organization also holds\\ncommercial paper issued by the ABCP program, a banking organization would be permitted to\\ncalculate risk-weighted assets only for the liquidity facility if the banking organization assumes,\\nfor purposes of calculating risk-based capital requirements, that the liquidity facility would be\\nrequired to fund the defaulted assets. In this case, the banking organization would be maintaining\\ncapital to cover losses on the commercial paper when calculating capital requirements for the\\nliquidity facility, so there is no need to assign a separate capital requirement for the commercial\\npaper held by the banking organization.\\nSecond, the proposal would also allow a banking organization to recognize an overlap\\nbetween relevant risk-based requirements for securitization exposures under subpart E and\\nmarket risk covered positions under subpart F, provided the banking organization is able to\\n140\\nAn overlapping exposure occurs when a banking organization is exposed to the same risk to\\nthe same obligor through multiple direct or indirect exposures to that obligor.\\nPage 149 of 1089\\ncalculate and compare the capital requirements for the relevant exposures. For example, a\\nbanking organization could hold a correlation trading position that would be subject to the\\nproposed requirements under subpart F but would preclude losses in all circumstances on a\\nseparate securitization exposure held by the banking organization that would be subject to\\nrequirements under subpart E under the proposal. In such cases, the proposal would allow the\\nbanking organization to calculate the risk-based requirement for the overlapping portion of the\\nexposures based on the greater of the requirement under subpart E or under subpart F.\\nQuestion 67: What challenges, if any, would the option to recognize an overlap between\\nmarket risk covered and noncovered positions introduce? To what degree do banking\\norganizations anticipate recognizing overlaps between market risk covered and noncovered\\npositions?\\nLook-through approach for senior securitization exposures\\nThe proposal would introduce a provision that would allow a banking organization to cap\\nthe risk weight applied to a senior securitization exposure that is not a resecuritization exposure\\nat the weighted-average risk weight of the underlying exposures, provided that the banking\\norganization has knowledge of the composition of all of the underlying exposures (also referred\\nto as the \\xe2\\x80\\x9clook-through approach\"). For purposes of calculating the weighted-average risk\\nweight, the unpaid principal balance would be used as the weight for each exposure. The\\nproposal would define a senior securitization exposure as an exposure that has a first priority\\nclaim on the cash flows from the underlying exposures. When determining whether a\\nsecuritization exposure has a first priority claim on the cash flows from the underlying\\nexposures, a banking organization would not be required to consider amounts due under interest\\nrate derivative contracts, exchange rate derivative contracts, and servicer cash advance facility\\nii.\\nPage 150 of 1089\\ncontracts, 141\\nor any fees and other similar payments to be made by the securitization SPE to other\\nparties. Both the most senior commercial paper issued by an ABCP program and a liquidity\\nfacility that supports the ABCP program may be senior securitization exposures if the liquidity\\nfacility provider\\'s right to reimbursement of the drawn amounts is senior to all claims on the\\ncash flows from the underlying exposures, except amounts due under interest rate derivative\\ncontracts, exchange rate derivative contracts, and servicer cash advance facility contracts, fees\\ndue, and other similar payments.\\nAccordingly, under the proposed look-through approach, if a senior securitization\\nexposure\\'s underlying pool of assets consists solely of loans with a weighted average risk weight\\nof 100 percent, the risk weight for the senior securitization exposure would be the lower of the\\nrisk weight calculated under the SEC-SA and 100 percent. The proposed risk-weight cap is\\nintended to recognize that the credit risk associated with each dollar of a senior securitization\\nexposure generally will not be greater than the credit risk associated with each dollar of the\\nunderlying assets, because the non-senior tranches of a securitization provide credit enhancement\\nto the senior tranche.\\nNotwithstanding the proposed risk weight cap, the proposal would require banking\\norganizations to floor the total risk-based capital requirement under the look-through approach at\\n15 percent, consistent with the proposed 15 percent floor under the SEC-SA. The proposed 15\\npercent floor, even if it results in a risk weight amount greater than the risk weight cap, is\\nintended to appropriately reflect the minimum amount of risk-based capital that a banking\\n141\\nA servicer cash advance facility means a facility under which the servicer of the underlying\\nexposures of a securitization may advance cash to ensure an uninterrupted flow of payments to\\ninvestors in the securitization, including advances made to cover foreclosure costs or other\\nexpenses to facilitate the timely collection of the underlying exposures.\\nPage 151 of 1089\\norganization should maintain for such exposures given that the process of securitization can\\nintroduce additional risks that are not present in the underlying exposures such as modelling risks\\nand correlation risks.\\nCredit-enhancing interest only strips\\nThe proposal would require a banking organization to deduct from common equity tier 1\\ncapital any portion of a CEIO strip\\xc2\\xb942 that does not constitute an after-tax-gain-on sale, regardless\\nof whether the securitization exposure meets the proposed operational requirements. The\\nproposed treatment for CEIOS would be different than under subpart D of the current capital rule,\\nwhich requires a risk weight of 1,250 percent for these items. The agencies are proposing to\\nrequire deduction from common equity tier 1 capital because valuations of CEIOs can include a\\nhigh degree of subjectivity and, just like assets subject to deduction under the current capital rule\\nsuch as goodwill and other intangible assets, banking organizations may not be able to fully\\nrealize value from CEIOS based on their balance sheet carrying amounts. While a deduction is\\ngenerally equivalent to a 1,250 percent risk weight when the banking organization maintains an 8\\npercent capital ratio, given the various capital ratios, buffers, and add-ons applicable to banking\\norganizations subject to subpart E, applying a deduction provides a more consistent treatment\\nacross ratios and banking organizations.\\niv. NPL securitizations\\n111.\\nThe proposal would define an NPL securitization as a securitization whose underlying\\nexposures consist solely of loans where parameter W for the underlying pool is greater than or\\n142\\nSee \\xc2\\xa7.2 for the definition of credit-enhancing interest-only strip.\\nPage 152 of 1089\\nequal to 90 percent at the origination cut-off date \\xc2\\xb943 and at any subsequent date on which assets\\nare added to or removed from the pool due to replenishment or restructuring. A securitization\\nexposure that meets the definition of a resecuritization exposure would be excluded from the\\ndefinition of an NPL securitization.\\nIn a typical NPL securitization, the originating banking organization sells the non-\\nperforming loans to a securitization SPE at a significant discount to the outstanding loan\\nbalances (reflecting the nonperforming nature of the underlying exposures) and this discount acts\\nas a credit enhancement to investors. Unlike the performance of securitizations of performing\\nloans, which principally depend on the cash flows of the underlying loans, the performance of\\nNPL securitizations depends in part on the performance of workouts on defaulted loans, which\\nare uncertain and could be volatile, and on the liquidation of underlying collateral for those loans\\nwhich are unable to be cured.\\nThe proposal would introduce a specific approach for NPL securitization exposures as the\\nproposed SEC-SA may be inappropriate for the unique risks of such exposures. The proposal\\nwould require a banking organization to assign a risk weight of 100 percent to a securitization\\nexposure to an NPL securitization if the following conditions are satisfied: (1) the transaction\\nstructure meets the definition of a traditional securitization; (2) the securitization has a credit\\nenhancement in the form of a nonrefundable purchase price discount greater than or equal to 50\\npercent of the outstanding balance of the pool of exposures; and (3) the banking organization\\'s\\nexposure is a senior securitization exposure as described in section III.D.3.b.ii. of this\\n143 Cut-off date is the date on which the composition of the asset pool collateralizing a\\nsecuritization transaction is established. This means that all assets to be included in a\\nsecuritization must already be in existence and meet the NPL criteria as of that date.\\nPage 153 of 1089\\nSupplementary Information. \\xc2\\xb944 Using the SEC-SA for senior securitizations of NPLs that meet\\nthese criteria would result in capital requirements that do not reflect the nonrefundable purchase\\nprice discount associated with these transactions. The SEC-SA is calibrated on the basis that the\\nloans in the pool at origination are generally performing and is therefore inappropriate for senior\\nexposures to securitizations of NPLs that meet these criteria.\\nIf the NPL securitization exposure is not a senior securitization exposure or the purchase\\nprice discount is less than 50 percent, the banking organization would be required to use the\\nSEC-SA to calculate the risk weight (subject to a risk weight floor of 100 percent and reflecting\\nall delinquent exposures in calculating parameter W). If the exposure does not meet the\\nrequirements of the SEC-SA, the banking organization must assign a risk weight of 1,250 to the\\nexposure.\\nI. Attachment and detachment points for NPL securitizations\\nUnder the proposal, the nonrefundable purchase price discount would equal the\\ndifference between the outstanding balance of the underlying exposures and the price at which\\nthese exposures are sold by the originator \\xc2\\xb945 to investors on a final basis without recourse\\nthrough the securitization SPE, when neither the originator nor the original lender are eligible for\\nfuture reimbursement for this difference (that is, that the purchase price discount is \\xe2\\x80\\x9cnon-\\nrefundable\"). In cases where the originator underwrites tranches of the NPL securitization for\\nsubsequent sale, a banking organization may include in the calculation of the nonrefundable\\n144\\nIf the banking organization is an originating banking organization with respect to the NPL\\nsecuritization, the banking organization may maintain risk-based capital against the transferred\\nexposures as if they had not been securitized and must deduct from common equity tier 1 capital\\nany after-tax gain-on-sale resulting from the transaction and any portion of a CEIO strip that\\ndoes not constitute an after-tax gain-on-sale.\\n145 While originator typically refers to the party originating the underlying loans, in the NPL\\ncontext it refers to the party arranging the NPL securitization (i.e., the securitizer).\\nPage 154 of 1089\\npurchase price discount the differences between the outstanding balance of the underlying\\nnonperforming loans and the price at which the tranches are first sold to third parties unrelated to\\nthe originator. For any given piece of a securitization tranche, a banking organization may only\\ntake into account the initial sale from the originator to investors in the determination of the\\nnonrefundable purchase price discount and may not account for any subsequent secondary re-\\nsales.\\nSince the calculation of parameters A and D both depend on the outstanding balance of\\nthe assets in the underlying pool, any nonrefundable purchase price discount associated with a\\nsecuritization would be included in both the numerator and denominator of parameters A and D.\\nFor example, assume an originating banking organization transfers a pool of mortgage loans with\\nan outstanding balance of $100 million to a securitization SPE at a price of $60 million. The\\nnonrefundable purchase price discount would be the difference between the unpaid principal\\nbalances on the underlying mortgages at the time of sale to the securitization SPE and the price\\nat which the originating banking organization sold these mortgages to the securitization SPE\\n(that is, $40 million). Assume that the securitization SPE issues $60 million in securitization\\ntranches of which the banking organization retains the senior $50 million tranche and an\\ninvesting banking organization purchases the $10 million first-loss tranche. Parameter A for the\\ninvesting banking organization\\'s exposure would equal 40 percent (that is, the ratio of $40\\nmillion to $100 million). Thus, the discount paid for the underlying assets is effectively the \"first\\nloss\" position in the securitization. Likewise, the originating banking organization would treat\\nboth the nonrefundable purchase price discount and the investing banking organization\\'s tranche\\nas subordinate and would set Parameter A at 50 percent.\\nPage 155 of 1089\\nIf, in the example above, the originating bank sells both tranches and each tranche is sold\\nat a 20 percent discount (that is, the $10 million first loss tranche is sold for a price of $8 million\\nand the $50 million senior tranche is sold for a price of $40 million), the investing banking\\norganization that purchases the first-loss tranche would be permitted to assign an attachment\\npoint of 52 percent to its exposure, because the nonrefundable purchase price discount would be\\nthe difference between the original outstanding amount of the exposures ($100 million) and the\\ntotal notional value of all the securitization tranches ($48 million). The investing banking\\norganization that purchases the senior tranche would be permitted to assign an attachment point\\nof 60 percent to the exposure.\\n4. Credit risk mitigation for securitization exposures\\nThe proposal would replace the existing credit risk mitigation framework under subpart E\\nwith a framework that is consistent with the credit risk mitigation framework under subpart D of\\nthe current capital rule,\\xc2\\xb946 with one exception. A banking organization that purchases or sells\\ntranched credit protection, whether hedged or unhedged, referencing part of a senior tranche\\nwould not be allowed to treat the lower-priority portion that the credit protection does not\\nreference as a senior securitization exposure. For example, if a banking organization holds a\\nsecuritization exposure with an attachment point of 20 percent and a detachment point of 100\\npercent and the banking organization purchases an eligible guarantee with an attachment point of\\n50 percent and a detachment point of 100 percent, the banking organization\\'s residual exposure,\\nwhich attaches at 20 percent and detaches at 50 percent, would be considered a non-senior\\n146\\nIn particular, the proposal would eliminate references to model-based approaches that are\\ncurrently contained in subpart E. The proposal would also eliminate the formula for collateral\\nrecognition under subpart E, which includes standard supervisory haircuts calibrated to a 65-day\\nholding period and permits banking organizations to calculate their own estimates of haircuts\\nwith prior supervisory approval.\\nPage 156 of 1089\\nsecuritization exposure, and the banking organization would not be permitted to apply the look-\\nthrough approach to this exposure. A banking organization that purchases a mezzanine tranche\\nthat attaches at 20 percent and detaches at 50 percent has a similar economic exposure to a\\nbanking organization that purchases a senior tranche that attaches at 20 percent and detaches at\\n100 percent and then purchases credit protection that attaches at 50 percent and detaches at 100\\npercent. Since the former transaction would not be considered a senior securitization exposure\\neligible for the look-through approach, the agencies believe that the latter transaction likewise\\nshould not be eligible for the look-through approach. Alternatively, the banking organization\\nmay choose not to recognize the tranched credit protection, in which case, the banking\\norganization may treat the securitization exposure (which attaches at 20 percent and detaches at\\n100 percent) as a senior securitization exposure.\\nE. Equity Exposures\\nEquity exposures present a greater risk of loss relative to credit exposures as equity\\nexposures represent an ownership interest in the issuer of an equity instrument and have a lower\\npriority of payment or reimbursement in the event that the issuing entity fails to meet its credit\\nobligations. For example, an equity exposure entitles a banking organization to no more than the\\npro-rata residual value of a company after all other creditors, including subordinated debt\\nholders, are repaid. As a result, consistent with the current capital rule, the proposal would\\ngenerally assign higher risk weights to equity exposures than exposures subject to the proposed\\ncredit risk framework.\\nThe current capital rule\\'s advanced approaches equity framework permits use of an\\ninternal models approach for publicly traded and non-publicly traded equity exposures and\\nequity derivative contracts. The proposal would not include an internal models approach because\\nPage 157 of 1089\\nof the types of equity exposures that would likely be subject to the equity framework. Under the\\nproposal, material publicly traded equity exposures would generally be subject to the proposed\\nmarket risk framework described in section III.H of this Supplementary Information, unless there\\nare restrictions on the tradability of such exposures. \\xc2\\xb947 Similarly, equity exposures to investment\\nfunds for which the banking organization has access to the investment fund\\'s prospectus,\\npartnership agreement, or similar contract that defines the fund\\'s permissible investments and\\ninvestment limits, and is either able to (1) calculate a market risk capital requirement for its\\nproportional ownership share of each exposure held by the investment fund, or (2) obtain daily\\nprice quotes - would generally be subject to the proposed market risk framework.\\xc2\\xb948 As the\\nproposed equity framework would primarily cover illiquid or infrequently traded equity\\nexposures, the proposal would require banking organizations to use a standardized approach to\\ndetermine capital requirements for such equity exposures. This is intended to increase the\\ntransparency of the capital framework and facilitate comparisons of capital adequacy across\\nbanking organizations.\\nThe proposed framework would largely maintain those sections of the current capital\\nrule\\'s equity framework that do not rely on models, including the definition of equity\\nexposure, \\xc2\\xb949 the definition of investment fund, the treatment of stable value protection, and the\\nmethods for measuring the exposure amount for equity exposures. The proposal would make\\ncertain modifications to improve the risk sensitivity and robustness of the risk-based capital\\nWhile the proposal would require banking organizations that are not subject to the proposed\\nmarket risk capital framework to calculate risk-weighted assets for all publicly traded equity\\nexposures under the proposed equity framework, such entities typically do not have material\\nequity exposures.\\n148 See \\xc2\\xa7_.202 for the proposed definition of market risk covered position.\\n149\\nSee 12 CFR part 3.2 (OCC); 12 CFR part 217.2 (Board); 12 CFR part 324.2 (FDIC).\\n147\\nPage 158 of 1089\\nrequirements for equity exposures relative to the current capital rule. Specifically, the proposal\\nwould: (1) eliminate the 100 percent risk weight threshold category under the simple risk-weight\\napproach for non-significant equity exposures; (2) eliminate the effective and ineffective hedge\\npair treatment under the simple risk-weight approach; (3) align the conversion factors for\\nconditional commitments to acquire an equity exposure, consistent with the proposed off-balance\\nsheet treatment for exposures subject to the proposed credit risk framework, and (4) increase the\\nrisk weight applicable to equity exposures to investment firms with greater than immaterial\\nleverage that the primary federal supervisor has determined do not qualify as a traditional\\nsecuritization. Additionally, the proposal would enhance the risk-sensitivity of the current capital\\nrule\\'s look-through approaches for equity exposures to investment funds by (1) specifying a\\nhierarchy of approaches that a banking organization would be required to use based on the nature\\nand quality of the information available to the banking organization concerning the investment\\nfund\\'s underlying assets and liabilities; (2) modifying the full look-through and the alternative\\nlook-through approaches to explicitly capture off-balance sheet exposures held by an investment\\nfund, the counterparty credit risk and CVA risk of any underlying derivatives held by the\\ninvestment fund, and the leverage of the investment fund; (3) replacing the simple modified\\nlook-through approach with a flat 1,250 percent risk weight, and (4) flooring the risk weight\\napplicable to an equity exposure to an investment fund at 20 percent, consistent with the\\nstandardized approach in the current capital rule.\\n1. Risk-weighted Asset Amount\\nThe proposal would retain the risk-weighted asset amount calculation under the current\\ncapital rule. Consistent with the current capital rule, the proposal would require a banking\\norganization to determine the risk-weighted asset amount for each equity exposure, except for\\nPage 159 of 1089\\nequity exposures to investment funds, by multiplying the adjusted carrying value of the exposure\\nby the lowest applicable risk weight, as described below in section III.E.1.b. of this\\nSupplementary Information. A banking organization would determine the risk-weighted asset\\namount for an equity exposure to an investment fund by multiplying the adjusted carrying value\\nof the exposure by either the risk weight calculated under one of the look-through approaches or\\nby a risk weight of 1,250 percent, as described below in section III.E.1.c. of this Supplementary\\nInformation. A banking organization would calculate its aggregate risk-weighted asset amount\\nfor equity exposures as the sum of the risk-weighted asset amount calculated for each equity\\nexposure.\\n150\\na. Adjusted Carrying Value\\nUnder the proposal, the adjusted carrying value of an equity exposure, including equity\\nexposures to investment funds, would be based on the type of exposure, as described in Table 1\\nbelow.\\nTable 1: Adjusted Carrying Value for Equity Exposures\\nEquity exposure type\\nOn-balance sheet component of an equity\\nexposure\\nUnconditional commitment to acquire an\\nequity exposure\\nAdjusted carrying value\\nThe carrying value of the exposure.\\nThe effective notional principal amount of\\nthe exposure multiplied by a 100 percent\\nconversion factor.\\n150 The proposal would exclude from the proposed equity framework equity exposures that a\\nbanking organization would be required to deduct from regulatory capital under\\n\\xc2\\xa7_.22(d)(2)(i)(C) of the proposal. The proposal would require a banking organization to assign a\\n250 percent risk weight to the amount of the significant investments in the common stock of\\nunconsolidated financial institutions that is not deducted from common equity tier 1 capital.\\nPage 160 of 1089\\nConditional commitment to acquire an equity\\nexposure\\nOff-balance sheet component of an equity\\nexposure that is not an equity commitment\\xc2\\xb951\\nThe effective notional principal amount of\\nthe exposure multiplied by a 40 percent\\nconversion factor.\\nThe effective notional principal amount \\xc2\\xb952 of\\nthe exposure, the size of which is equivalent\\nto a hypothetical on-balance sheet position in\\nthe underlying equity instrument that would\\nevidence the same change in fair value\\n(measured in dollars) for a given small\\nchange in the price of the underlying equity\\ninstrument, minus the adjusted carrying value\\nof the on-balance sheet component of the\\nexposure.\\nThe proposal would maintain the current capital rule\\'s methods for calculating the\\nadjusted carrying value for equity exposures, with one exception. The proposal would simplify\\nthe treatment of conditional commitments to acquire an equity exposure to remove the\\ndifferentiation of conversion factors by maturity. The proposal would require a banking\\norganization to multiply the effective notional principal amount of a conditional commitment by\\n151 Consistent with the current capital rule, the proposal would allow a banking organization to\\nchoose not to hold risk-based capital against the counterparty credit risk of equity derivative\\ncontracts, as long as it does so for all such contracts. Where the equity derivative contracts are\\nsubject to a qualified master netting agreement, the proposal would require the banking\\norganization to either include all or exclude all of the contracts from any measure used to\\ndetermine counterparty credit risk exposure. See \\xc2\\xa7__.113(d) of the proposal.\\n152 Consistent with the current capital rule, the proposal includes the concept of the effective\\nnotional principal amount of the off-balance sheet portion of an equity exposure to provide a\\nuniform method for banking organizations to measure the on-balance sheet equivalent of an off-\\nbalance sheet exposure. For example, if the value of a derivative contract referencing the\\ncommon stock of company X changes the same amount as the value of 150 shares of common\\nstock of company X, for a small change (for example, 1.0 percent) in the value of the common\\nstock of company X, the effective notional principal amount of the derivative contract is the\\ncurrent value of 150 shares of common stock of company X, regardless of the number of shares\\nthe derivative contract references. The adjusted carrying value of the off-balance sheet\\ncomponent of the derivative is the current value of 150 shares of common stock of company X\\nminus the adjusted carrying value of any on-balance sheet amount associated with the derivative.\\nPage 161 of 1089\\na 40 percent conversion factor to calculate its adjusted carrying value. The 40 percent conversion\\nfactor is meant to appropriately account for the risk of conditional equity commitments, which\\nprovide the banking organization more flexibility to exit the commitment relative to\\nunconditional equity commitments.\\nb. Expanded simple risk-weight approach (ESRWA)\\nUnder the proposal, the risk-weighted asset amount for an equity exposure, except for\\nequity exposures to investment funds, would be the product of the adjusted carrying value of the\\nequity exposure multiplied by the lowest applicable risk weight in Table 2.\\nTable 2: Risk Weights Applicable to Equity Exposures under the Expanded Simple\\nRisk-Weight Approach (ESRWA)\\nRisk Weight\\n0%\\n20%\\n100%\\n250%\\nEquity Exposure\\nAn equity exposure to a sovereign, the Bank for International Settlements,\\nthe European Central Bank, the European Commission, the International\\nMonetary Fund, the European Stability Mechanism, the European\\nFinancial Stability Facility, a multilateral development bank, and any\\nother entity whose credit exposures receive a zero percent risk weight\\nunder \\xc2\\xa7. 111 of the proposal.\\nAn equity exposure to a PSE, FHLB, or Farmer Mac.\\nAn equity exposure that qualifies as a community development\\ninvestment under section 24 (Eleventh) of the National Bank Act.\\nAn equity exposure to an unconsolidated small business investment\\ncompany or held through a consolidated small business investment\\ncompany, as described in section 302 of the Small Business Investment\\nAct.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 A publicly traded equity exposure.\"\\n153\\n153 The proposal would rely on the existing definition of publicly traded under the current capital\\nrule.

Specifically, to enhance risk\\nsensitivity and simplify the equity framework, the proposal would eliminate the following risk\\nweights within the current capital rule\\'s simple risk-weight approach: (1) the 100 percent risk\\nweight for non-significant equity exposures whose aggregate adjusted carrying value does not\\nexceed 10 percent of the banking organization\\'s total capital, and (2) the 100 and 300 percent\\nrisk weights for the effective and ineffective portion of hedge pairs, respectively. Given the\\nremoval of the 100 percent risk weight threshold category for non-significant equity exposures\\nand the revised scope of equity exposures subject to the proposed equity framework, the proposal\\nwould (1) assign a 100 percent risk weight to equity exposures to Small Business Investment\\n154\\nConsistent with the current capital rule, the proposal would require banking organizations to\\napply the 250 percent risk weight to the net long position, as calculated under section ___.22(h),\\nthat is not deducted from capital pursuant to section ____.22(d)(2)(i)(C).\\nPage 163 of 1089\\nCompanies and (2) generally assign a 250 percent risk weight to publicly traded equity exposures\\nwith restrictions on tradability,\\xc2\\xb9\\n155 as described in more detail below. Finally, the proposal would\\nintroduce a 1,250 percent risk weight to replace the 600 percent risk weight in the simple risk-\\nweight approach under subpart E of the current capital rule for equity exposures to investment\\nfirms that have greater than immaterial leverage and that the primary federal supervisor has\\ndetermined do not qualify as a traditional securitization exposure, as described in more detail\\nbelow.\\nRemoving the 100 percent risk weight for non-significant equity exposures is intended to\\nincrease the risk sensitivity of the equity framework by requiring banking organizations to apply\\na risk weight based on the characteristics of each equity exposure, rather than only for those in\\nexcess of 10 percent of the banking organization\\'s total capital. Given that primarily illiquid or\\ninfrequently traded equity positions would be subject to the proposed equity framework, the\\nproposal would remove the 100 and 300 percent risk weights under the current capital rule for\\nthe effective and ineffective portions of hedge pairs. The hedge pair treatment under the current\\ncapital rule is only available if each of the equity exposures is publicly traded or has a return that\\nis primarily based on a publicly traded equity exposure. As such positions would generally be\\nsubject to the proposed market risk capital framework under the proposal, the agencies are\\nproposing to eliminate the hedge pair treatment to simplify the risk-weighting framework under\\nthe proposal.\\n155\\ni.\\nCommunity Development Investments and Small Business Investment\\nBanking organizations that would be subject to the proposed enhanced risk-based capital\\nframework but not the proposed market risk capital requirements would be required to assign a\\n250 percent risk weight to all publicly traded equity positions that are not equity exposures to\\ninvestment funds.\\nPage 164 of 1089\\nCompanies\\nThe current capital rule assigns a 100 percent risk weight to equity exposures that either\\n(1) qualify as a community development investment under section 24 (Eleventh) of the National\\nBank Act, or (2) represent non-significant equity exposures to the extent that the aggregate\\nadjusted carrying value of the exposures does not exceed 10 percent of the banking\\norganization\\'s total capital. Under the current capital rule, when determining which equity\\nexposures are \"non-significant\" and thus eligible for a 100 percent risk weight, a banking\\norganization first must include equity exposures to an unconsolidated small business investment\\ncompany or held through a consolidated small business investment company described in section\\n302 of the Small Business Investment Act of 1958 (15 U.S.C. 682).\\xc2\\xb956 As depository institutions\\nare limited by statute to only invest up to 5 percent of total capital in the equity exposures and\\ndebt instruments of small business investment companies, the current capital rule effectively\\nassigns a 100 percent risk weight to all equity exposures to such programs.\\nEquity exposures to community development investments and small business investment\\ncompanies generally receive favorable tax treatment and/or investment subsidies that make their\\nrisk and return characteristics different than equity investments in general. Recognizing this\\nmore favorable risk-return structure and the importance of these investments to promoting\\nimportant public welfare goals, the proposal would effectively retain the treatment of equity\\nexposures that qualify as community development investments and equity exposures to small\\nbusiness investment companies under the current capital rule and assign such exposures a 100\\npercent risk weight.\\n156\\nSee 12 CFR 3.152(b)(3)(iii)(B) (OCC); 12 CFR 217.152(b)(3)(iii)(B) (Board); 12 CFR\\n324.152(b)(3)(iii)(B) (FDIC).\\nPage 165 of 1089\\nii.\\nPublicly traded equity with tradability restrictions\\xc2\\xb9\\nTo appropriately capture the risk of publicly traded equity exposures with restrictions on\\ntradability, the proposal would (1) eliminate the 100 percent risk weight for non-significant\\nequity exposures up to 10 percent of total capital under the current capital rule; and (2) introduce\\na 250 percent risk weight to replace the current capital rule\\'s 300 percent risk weight applicable\\nto publicly traded exposures. \\xc2\\xb958 The revised calibration of the risk-weight for publicly traded\\nequity exposures with restrictions on tradability is intended to take into account the removal of\\nthe non-significant equity exposures treatment. Under the proposal, banking organizations would\\nno longer assign separate risk weights (100 percent and 300 percent) to publicly traded equity\\nexposures based on factors that are unrelated to the underlying risk of the exposure. Instead, the\\nproposal would assign an identical 250 percent risk weight to all publicly traded equity\\nexposures with restrictions on tradability, improving the consistency and risk-sensitivity of the\\nframework.\\n157\\niii.\\nEquity exposures to investment firms with greater than immaterial leverage and\\nthat would meet the definition of a traditional securitization were it not for the\\napplication of paragraph (8) of that definition\\nConsistent with the current capital rule, the proposed securitization framework generally\\nwould apply to exposures to investment firms with material liabilities that are not operating\\n157\\nThe proposal would require banking organizations that are not subject to the proposed market\\nrisk capital framework to calculate risk-weighted assets for all publicly traded equity exposures\\nunder the proposed equity framework.\\n158\\nEquity exposures, including preferred stock exposures, to the FHLBs and Farmer Mac would\\ncontinue to receive a 20 percent risk weight.\\nPage 166 of 1089\\n159\\ncompanies, unless the primary federal supervisor determines the exposure is not a traditional\\nsecuritization based on its leverage, risk profile or economic substance.160,161 For an equity\\nexposure to an investment firm that has greater than immaterial leverage and that the primary\\nfederal supervisor has determined does not qualify as a traditional securitization exposure, the\\nproposal would increase the 600 percent risk weight in the simple risk-weight approach under\\nsubpart E of the current capital rule to 1,250 percent under the proposed expanded simple risk-\\nweight approach. As under the current capital rule, the applicable risk weight for equity\\nexposures to such investment firms with greater than immaterial liabilities under the proposed\\n159\\nOperating companies generally refer to companies that are established to conduct business\\nwith clients with the intention of earning a profit in their own right and generally produce goods\\nor provide services beyond the business of investing, reinvesting, holding, or trading in financial\\nassets. Accordingly, an equity investment in an operating company generally would be an equity\\nexposure under the proposal and subject to the proposed enhanced simple risk-weight approach.\\nConsistent with the current capital rule, under the proposal, banking organizations would be\\noperating companies and would not fall under the definition of a traditional securitization.\\nHowever, investment firms that generally do not produce goods or provide services beyond the\\nbusiness of investing, reinvesting, holding, or trading in financial assets, would not be operating\\ncompanies, and would not qualify for the general exclusion from the definition of traditional\\nsecuritization.\\n160\\nIn general, such entities qualify as \"traditional securitizations\" unless explicitly scoped out by\\ncriterion (10) of that definition (for example collective investment funds, as defined in 12 CFR\\n208.34, as well as entities registered with the SEC under the Investment Company Act of 1940,\\n15 U.S.C. 80a-1, or foreign equivalents thereof). As the definition of \"traditional securitization\"\\ndoes not include exposures to entities where all or substantially all of the underlying exposures\\nare not financial exposures, equity exposures to Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) generally\\nwould be treated in a similar manner to equity exposures to operating companies and, unless they\\nqualify as market risk covered positions, would be subject to the proposed expanded simple risk-\\nweight approach of the equity framework.\\n161\\nFor example, for an equity security issued by a qualifying venture capital fund, as defined\\nunder section__.10(c)(16) of each agency\\'s regulations implementing section 13 of the BHC\\nAct, that also has outstanding debt securities, the proposal would generally require a banking\\norganization to treat the exposure as a traditional securitization exposure if the exposure would\\nmeet all of the criteria of the definition of traditional securitization under section ____.2 of the\\ncurrent capital rule unless the primary federal supervisor determines the exposure is not a\\ntraditional securitization.\\nPage 167 of 1089\\nsecuritization framework would depend on the size of the first loss tranche. 162 For investment\\nfirms that have greater than immaterial leverage, their capital structure may result in a large first\\nloss tranche that understates the risk of the exposure to the investment firm. Unlike most\\ntraditional securitization structures, investment firms that can easily change the size and\\ncomposition of their capital structure (as well as the size and composition of their assets and off-\\nbalance sheet exposures) may pose additional risks not covered by the securitization framework.\\nFor example, the performance of an equity exposure to an investment firm with greater than\\nimmaterial liabilities may depend in part on management discretion regarding asset composition\\nand capital structure. To appropriately capture the additional risks posed by equity exposures to\\ninvestment firms with greater than immaterial liabilities that may not be reflected within the\\nproposed securitization framework, the proposal would permit the primary federal supervisor to\\ndetermine that the exposure is not a traditional securitization and require the banking\\norganization to apply a 1,250 percent risk weight to the adjusted carrying value of equity\\nexposures to such investment firms. 163\\nConsistent with the current capital rule, under the proposal, an equity exposure to an\\ninvestment firm that is treated as a traditional securitization would be subject to due diligence\\nrequirements. If a banking organization is unable to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the\\nprimary federal supervisor a comprehensive understanding of the features of an equity exposure\\nthat would materially affect the performance of the exposure, the proposal would require the\\nbanking organization to assign a risk weight of 1,250 percent to the equity exposure to the\\ninvestment firm.\\n162\\n163 Consistent with the current capital rule, the agencies will consider the economic substance,\\nleverage, and risk profile of a transaction to ensure that an appropriate risk-based capital\\ntreatment is applied. The agencies will consider a number of factors when assessing the\\neconomic substance of a transaction including, for example, the amount of equity in the\\nstructure, overall leverage (whether on or off-balance sheet), whether redemption rights attach to\\nthe equity investor, and the ability of the junior tranches to absorb losses without interrupting\\ncontractual payments to more senior tranches.\\nPage 168 of 1089\\nQuestion 68: The agencies request comment on the proposed application of a 1,250\\npercent risk weight to equity exposures to investment firms with greater than immaterial\\nleverage and that would meet the definition of a traditional securitization were it not for the\\napplication of paragraph (8) of that definition.

Provide\\nsupporting data and examples.\\nc. Risk Weights for Equity Exposures to Investment Funds\\nThe separate risk-based capital treatment for equity exposures to investment funds under\\nthe current capital rule reflects that the risk of equity exposures to investment fund structures\\nPage 169 of 1089\\ndepends primarily on the nature of the underlying assets held by the fund and the degree of\\nleverage employed by the fund. Consistent with the current capital rule, the proposal would\\nrequire banking organizations to determine the risk weight applicable to the adjusted carrying\\nvalue of each equity exposure to an investment fund using a look-through approach in the equity\\nframework. When more detailed information is available about the investment fund\\'s\\ncharacteristics, a banking organization is in a better position to evaluate the risk profile of its\\nequity exposure to the fund and calculate a risk weight commensurate with that risk. Conversely,\\nequity exposures to investment funds that provide less transparency or are not subject to regular\\nindependent verification could present elevated risk to banking organizations. Accordingly, the\\nproposal would specify a hierarchy that banking organizations would be required to use to\\nidentify the applicable look-through approach for each equity exposure to an investment fund\\nbased on the nature and quality of the information available to the banking organization.\\nThe proposal would also enhance the risk sensitivity of the current capital rule\\'s look-\\nthrough approaches under subpart E by modifying the full look-through and the alternative look-\\nthrough approaches to explicitly capture off-balance sheet exposures held by an investment fund,\\nthe counterparty credit risk and CVA risk of any underlying derivatives held by the investment\\nfund, and the leverage of an investment fund. The proposal would also replace the simple\\nmodified look-through approach under subpart E with a flat 1,250 percent risk-weight.\\nHierarchy of Look-Through Approaches\\nThe proposal would require a banking organization that is not subject to the proposed\\nmarket risk capital framework to use the full look-through approach if the banking organization\\nhas sufficient verified information about the underlying exposures of the investment fund to\\ni.\\nPage 170 of 1089\\n164\\ncalculate a risk-weighted asset amount for each of the exposures held by the investment fund.\\xc2\\xb9\\nIf a banking organization is unable to meet the criteria to use the full look-through approach, the\\nproposal would require the banking organization to apply the alternative modified look-through\\napproach and determine a risk-weighted asset amount for the exposures of the investment fund\\nbased on the information contained in the investment fund\\'s prospectus, partnership agreement,\\nor similar contract that defines the investment fund\\'s permissible investments. If the banking\\norganization is unable to apply either the full look-through approach or the alternative modified\\nlook-through approach, the proposal would require the banking organization to assign a 1,250\\npercent risk weight to the adjusted carrying value of the equity exposure to the investment fund.\\nBanking organizations generally would not be permitted to apply a combination of the above\\napproaches to determine the risk-weighted asset amount applicable to the adjusted carrying value\\nof an equity exposure to an investment fund, except for equity exposures to investment funds\\nwith underlying securitizations, or equity exposures to other investment funds, as described in\\nsection III.E.1.c.v. of this Supplementary Information.\\nii. Full Look-Through Approach\\nSince the full look-through approach is the most granular and risk-sensitive approach, the\\nproposal would require banking organizations that are not subject to the proposed market risk\\ncapital framework to use the full look-through approach when verified, detailed information\\nabout the underlying exposures of the investment fund is available to enhance risk-sensitivity of\\nthe risk-based capital requirements. Under the proposed hierarchy, such banking organizations\\n164 The proposal would require banking organizations subject to the market risk capital\\nrequirements to apply the proposed market risk capital framework to determine the risk-weighted\\nasset amount for equity exposures to investment funds that would otherwise be subject to the full\\nlook-through approach under the proposed equity framework. See \\xc2\\xa7_.202 for the proposed\\ndefinition of market risk covered position.\\nPage 171 of 1089\\nwould be required to use the full look-through approach if the banking organization is able to\\ncalculate a risk-weighted asset amount for each of the underlying exposures of the investment\\nfund as if the exposures were held directly by the banking organization, with the exception of\\nsecuritization exposures, derivative exposures, and equity exposures to other investment funds,\\nas described in section III.E.1.c.v. of this Supplementary Information.\\nSpecifically, the proposal would require banking organizations that are not subject to the\\nproposed market risk capital framework to apply the full look-through approach when there is\\nsufficient and frequent information provided to the banking organization regarding the\\nunderlying exposures of the investment fund. To satisfy this criterion, the frequency of financial\\nreporting of the investment fund must be at least quarterly, and the financial information must be\\nsufficient for the banking organization to calculate the risk-weighted asset amount for each\\nexposure held by the investment fund as if each exposure were held directly by the banking\\norganization (except for securitization exposures, derivatives exposures, and equity exposures to\\nother investment funds). In addition, such information would be required to be verified on at\\nleast a quarterly basis by an independent third party, such as a custodian bank or management\\nfund. 16\\n165\\nThe proposal would largely maintain the same risk-weight treatment as provided under\\nthe full look-through approach in the advanced approaches of the current capital rule, with five\\nexceptions. First, to facilitate application of the full look-through approach, the proposal would\\nallow banking organizations the option to use conservative alternative methods to those provided\\nunder the proposed expanded risk-weighted asset approach to calculate the risk-weighted asset\\n165\\nAs externally licensed auditors typically express their opinions on investment funds\\' accounts\\nrather than on the accuracy of the data used for the purposes of applying the full look-through\\napproach, an external audit would not be required.\\nPage 172 of 1089\\namount attributable to any underlying exposures that are securitizations, derivatives, or equity\\nexposures to another investment fund, as described in section III.E.1.c.v. of this Supplementary\\nInformation.\\nSecond, to increase comparability across banking organizations, the proposal would\\nclarify that the total risk-weighted asset amount for the investment fund under the full look-\\nthrough approach must include any off-balance sheet exposures of the investment fund and the\\ncounterparty credit risk and, where applicable, the CVA risk of any underlying derivative\\nexposures held by the investment fund. Accordingly, under the proposal, the total risk-weighted\\nasset amount for the investment fund under the full look-through approach would equal the sum\\nof the risk-weighted asset amount for (1) the on-balance sheet exposures, including any equity\\nexposures to other investment funds and securitization exposures; (2) the off-balance sheet\\nexposures, and (3) the counterparty credit risk and CVA risk, if applicable, of any underlying\\nderivative exposures held by the investment fund, as described in section III.E.1.c.v. of this\\nSupplementary Information.

For what types of investment funds would a banking organization rely on a source\\nother than the investment fund itself to obtain this information and what types of entities would it\\nrely on to obtain this information?\\niii. Alternative Modified Look-Through Approach\\nIf a banking organization is unable to meet the criteria to use the full look-through\\napproach, the proposal would require the banking organization to use the alternative modified\\n167 Under the proposal, a banking organization may exclude equity derivative contracts held by\\nthe investment fund for purposes of calculating the RWAderivatives component of the full and\\nalternative modified look-through approaches, if the banking organization has elected to exclude\\nequity derivative contracts for purposes of \\xc2\\xa7__.113(d) of the proposal.\\nPage 175 of 1089\\nlook-through approach, provided that the information contained in the investment fund\\'s\\nprospectus, partnership agreement, or similar contract is sufficient to determine the risk weight\\napplicable to each exposure type in which the investment fund is permitted to invest. 168 To\\naccount for the uncertain accuracy of risk assessments when banking organizations have limited\\ninformation about the underlying exposures of an investment fund or such information is not\\nverified on at least a quarterly basis by an independent third party, the alternative modified look-\\nthrough approach in the current capital rule requires banking organizations to use conservative\\nassumptions when calculating total risk-weighted assets for equity exposures to investment\\nfunds.\\nThe proposal would largely maintain the same risk-weight treatment as provided under\\nthe alternative modified look-through approach in the advanced approaches of the current capital\\nrule, with five exceptions. First, to increase comparability of the risk-based capital requirements\\napplicable to equity exposures to investment funds with investment policies that permit the\\ninvestment fund to hold equity exposures to other investment funds or securitization exposures,\\nthe proposed alternative modified look-through approach would specify the methods that\\nbanking organizations would be required to use to calculate risk-weighted assets for such\\nunderlying exposures, as described in section III.E.1.c.v. of this Supplementary Information.\\nSecond, to capture the risk of equity exposures to investment funds with investment\\npolicies that permit the use of off-balance sheet transactions or derivative contracts, the proposal\\nwould require banking organizations to include the off-balance sheet transactions as well as the\\n168 Under the proposal, banking organizations subject to the proposed market risk capital\\nrequirements would only apply the alternative modified look-through approach to such equity\\nexposures to investment funds if the banking organization is unable to obtain daily quotes for the\\nequity exposure to the investment fund. See \\xc2\\xa7_.202 for the proposed definition of market risk\\ncovered position.\\nPage 176 of 1089\\ncounterparty credit risk and CVA risk, if applicable, of the derivative contracts, when calculating\\nthe total risk-weighted asset amount for the investment fund. Specifically, the proposal would\\nrequire banking organizations to assume that the investment fund invests to the maximum extent\\npermitted under its investment limits in off-balance sheet transactions with the highest applicable\\ncredit conversion factor and risk weight.169 The proposal would also require banking\\norganizations to assume that the investment fund has the maximum volume of derivative\\ncontracts permitted under its investment limits. Under the proposal, the total risk-weighted asset\\namount for the investment fund under the alternative modified look-through approach would\\nequal the sum of the following risk-weighted asset amounts: (1) the on-balance sheet exposures,\\nincluding any equity exposures to other investment funds and securitization exposures; (2) the\\noff-balance sheet exposures, and (3) the counterparty credit risk and CVA risk, if applicable, for\\nderivative exposures, as described in section III.E.1.c.v. of this Supplementary Information. A\\nbanking organization would calculate the average risk weight for an equity exposure to the\\ninvestment fund by dividing the total risk-weighted asset amount for the investment fund by the\\ntotal assets of the investment fund.\\nThird, to capture the risk of equity exposures to investment funds with leverage, the\\nalternative modified look-through approach under the proposal would require a banking\\norganization to adjust the average risk weight for its equity exposure to the investment fund\\n169\\nFor example, if the mandate of an investment entity permits the use of unconditional equity\\ncommitments, the proposal would require the banking organization to multiply the notional\\namount of the commitment by a 100 percent credit conversion factor and the risk weight\\napplicable to the underlying reference exposure of the commitment. If the banking organization\\ndoes not know the type of equity underlying the commitment, the banking organization would be\\nrequired to use the highest applicable risk-weight to equity exposures.\\nPage 177 of 1089\\nupwards by the ratio of the total assets of the investment fund to the total equity of the\\ninvestment fund.\\nFourth, to avoid disincentivizing banking organizations from obtaining the necessary\\ninformation to apply the alternative modified look-through approach, the proposal would cap the\\nrisk weight applicable to an equity exposure to an investment fund under the alternative modified\\nlook-through approach at no more than 1,250 percent.\\nFifth, consistent with the standardized approach under the current capital rule, to reflect\\nthe agencies\\' and banking organizations\\' experience with money market fund investments and\\nsimilar investment funds during the 2008 financial crisis and the 2020 coronavirus response, the\\nproposal would floor the minimum risk weight that may be assigned to the adjusted carrying\\nvalue of any equity exposure to an investment fund under the proposed look-through approaches\\nat 20 percent.\\nAccordingly, under the proposal, a banking organization\\'s risk-weighted asset amount for\\nan equity exposure to an investment fund under the alternative modified look-through approach\\nwould be equal to the adjusted carrying value of the equity exposure multiplied by the lesser of\\n1,250 percent or the greater of either (1) the product of the average risk weight of the investment\\nfund multiplied by the leverage of the investment fund or (2) 20 percent.\\niv. 1,250 percent risk weight\\nWhen banking organizations have limited information on the underlying exposures or the\\nleverage of the investment fund, they have limited ability to appropriately capture and manage\\nthe risk and price volatility of such equity exposures. Accordingly, if a banking organization\\ndoes not have the necessary information to apply the full look-through approach or the\\nalternative modified look-through approach, the proposal would require the banking organization\\nPage 178 of 1089\\nto assign a 1,250 percent risk weight to the adjusted carrying value of its equity exposure to the\\ninvestment fund.\\nV. Risk weights for equity exposures to investment funds with underlying\\nsecuritizations, derivatives, or equity exposures to other investment funds\\nBanking organizations may not always be able to obtain the necessary information to\\ncalculate risk-weighted asset amounts under the full look-though approach or the alternative\\nmodified look-through approach for certain types of underlying exposures held by an investment\\nfund. For example, even if an investment fund provides detailed quarterly disclosures on all its\\nunderlying assets and liabilities, such disclosures may not identify the actual counterparty to each\\nunderlying derivative exposure of the investment fund or which of the underlying derivative\\nexposures of the investment fund are subject to the same qualified master netting agreement.\\nFurthermore, the information contained in an investment fund\\'s prospectus, partnership\\nagreement, or similar contract may not always allow banking organizations to calculate risk-\\nweighted asset amounts for such underlying exposures under the alternative modified look-\\nthrough approach.\\nTo facilitate application of the look-through approaches, the proposal would allow\\nbanking organizations to use conservative assumptions to calculate risk-weighted asset amounts\\nunder the full look-through approach for underlying exposures that are securitization exposures,\\nderivative exposures, or equity exposures to another investment fund. For purposes of the\\nalternative modified look-through approach, the proposal would require banking organizations to\\nuse these alternative assumptions for such underlying exposures.\\nPage 179 of 1089\\nSecuritization exposures\\nFor any securitization exposures held by an investment fund, the proposal would allow a\\nbanking organization using the full look-through approach to apply a 1,250 percent risk weight\\nto the exposure, if it cannot or chooses not to calculate the applicable risk weight under the\\nsecuritization standardized approach (SEC-SA), as described in section III.D. of this\\nSupplementary Information. The proposal would require a banking organization applying the\\nalternative modified look-through approach to apply a 1,250 percent risk weight to any\\nsecuritization exposures held by an investment fund.\\nII. Derivative exposures\\nFor derivative exposures held by an investment fund, the proposal would require a\\nbanking organization to calculate the risk-weighted asset amount for each derivative netting set\\nby multiplying the exposure amount of the netting set by the risk weight applicable to the\\nderivative counterparty under the proposed credit risk framework. To the extent a banking\\norganization cannot determine the counterparty, the proposal would require the banking\\norganization to multiply the resulting exposure amount by a 100 percent risk weight, as a\\nconservative approach to reflect the highest risk-weight that would be likely to apply to a\\ncounterparty to such transactions. 170\\nFor banking organizations using the full look-through approach, the proposal would\\nrequire a banking organization to use the replacement cost and the potential future exposure as\\ncalculated under SA-CCR to determine the exposure amount for each netting set of underlying\\n170\\nI.\\nRelatedly, to the extent a banking organization is unable to determine the netting sets of the\\nunderlying derivative exposures, the proposal would require each single derivative to be its own\\nnetting set.\\nPage 180 of 1089\\nderivative exposures (including single derivative contracts)\\xc2\\xb97\\xc2\\xb9 held by the investment fund,\\nwhere possible. 172 If a banking organization using the full look-through approach does not have\\nsufficient information to calculate the replacement cost or the potential future exposure for each\\nderivative netting set using SA-CCR or is using the alternative modified look-through approach,\\nthe proposal would require the banking organization to use the notional amount of each netting\\nset and 15 percent of the notional amount of each netting set for the replacement cost and\\npotential future exposure, respectively. The proposal would require banking organizations using\\nthe alternative modified look-through approach to use the notional amount of each netting set\\nand 15 percent of the notional amount of each netting set to determine the replacement cost and\\npotential future exposure, respectively. A banking organization would multiply the resulting\\nexposure amount by a factor of 1.4 if the banking organization determines that the counterparty\\nis not a commercial end-user or cannot determine whether the counterparty is a commercial end-\\nAdditionally, the proposal would require a banking organization to further multiply the\\nexposure amount by a factor of 1.5 for each derivative netting set that either qualifies (or for\\nwhich the banking organization cannot determine whether the exposure qualifies) as a CVA risk\\ncovered position, as defined in section III.I.3 of this Supplementary Information. Accordingly,\\n173\\nuser.\\n171 The proposal would rely on the existing definition of netting set under the current capital rule,\\nwhich is defined to include a single derivative contract between a banking organization and a\\nsingle counterparty. See 12 CFR 3.2 (OCC); 12 CFR 217.2 (Board); 12 CFR 324.2 (FDIC).\\n172 Under the proposal, a banking organization may exclude equity derivative contracts held by\\nthe investment fund for purposes of calculating the RWAderivatives component of the full and\\nalternative modified look-through approaches, if the banking organization has elected to exclude\\nequity derivative contracts for purposes of \\xc2\\xa7___.113(d) of the proposal.\\n173 The proposal would rely on the existing definition of commercial end-user under the current\\ncapital rule. See 12 CFR 3.2 (OCC); 12 CFR 217.2 (Board); 12 CFR 324.2 (FDIC).\\nPage 181 of 1089\\nthe proposal would require banking organizations to calculate the exposure amount for derivative\\nexposures held by an investment fund as described in the following formula:\\nExposure Amount = C *a (Replacement Cost + Potential Future Exposure)\\nWhere\\n\\xe2\\x97\\x8f\\nC would equal 1.5 if at least one of the derivative contracts in the netting set is a\\nCVA risk covered position or if the banking organization cannot determine\\nwhether one or more of the derivative contracts within the netting set is a CVA\\nrisk covered position; C would equal 1 if all of the derivative contracts within the\\nnetting set are not CVA risk covered positions;\\na would equal 1.4 if the banking organization determines that the counterparty is\\nnot a commercial end-user or cannot determine whether the counterparty is a\\ncommercial end-user, or 1 otherwise;\\nReplacement Cost would equal:\\n\\xe2\\x9e\\xa4 The replacement cost as calculated under SA-CCR for purposes of the full\\nlook-through approach, where possible; or\\n\\xe2\\x9e\\xa4 The notional amount of the derivative contract if the banking organization\\ncannot determine replacement cost under SA-CCR or is using the alternative\\nmodified look-through approach;\\nPotential Future Exposure would equal:\\n\\xe2\\x9e\\xa4 The potential future exposure as calculated under SA-CCR\\xc2\\xb974 for purposes\\nof the full look-through approach, where possible; or\\n174\\nIf the banking organization is not able to calculate the replacement cost of the netting set\\nunder SA-CCR but is able to calculate the PFE aggregated amount, the banking organization\\nmust set the PFE multiplier equal to 1.\\nPage 182 of 1089\\n\\xe2\\x9e\\xa4 15 percent of the notional amount of the derivative contract if the banking\\norganization cannot determine the potential future exposure under SA-CCR\\nor is using the alternative modified look-through approach.\\nThe proposal is intended to provide a conservative approach for banking organizations to\\ncalculate risk-weighted asset amounts for the underlying derivative exposures held by an\\ninvestment fund in a manner that appropriately captures the risk of such positions. For example,\\nusing 100 percent of the notional amount of the derivative contract as a proxy for the\\nreplacement cost is intended to provide a standardized and simple input to the exposure amount\\ncalculation when the necessary information about the replacement cost is not available. The\\nnotional amount of the derivative contract is typically larger than the fair value or replacement\\ncost of the contract and thus providing a conservative estimate of the maximum exposure that\\ncould arise for a derivative contract. Similarly, setting potential future exposure equal to 15\\npercent of the notional amount of the derivative contract is intended to provide a conservative\\nestimate of the potential losses that could arise from a counterparty credit risk exposure when the\\nlikelihood of significant changes in the value of the exposure increases over the longer term.\\nIII. Equity exposures to other investment funds\\nFor an equity exposure to an investment fund (e.g., Investment Fund A) that itself has a\\ndirect equity exposure to another investment fund (e.g., Investment Fund B), the proposal would\\nrequire a banking organization to determine the proportional amount of risk-weighted assets of\\nInvestment Fund A attributable to the underlying equity exposure to Investment Fund B using\\nthe hierarchy of approaches described in section III.E.1.c.i. of this Supplementary Information.\\nThat is, the banking organization may be required to apply the same or another approach to\\ndetermine the risk-weighted asset amount for Investment Fund A\\'s equity exposure to\\nPage 183 of 1089\\nInvestment Fund B than was used for the banking organization\\'s equity exposure to Investment\\nFund A, based on the nature and quality of the information available to the banking organization\\nregarding the underlying assets and liabilities of Investment Fund B.\\nFor all subsequent indirect equity exposure layers (e.g., Investment Fund B\\'s equity\\nexposure to Investment Fund C and so forth), the proposal would generally require the banking\\norganization to assign a 1,250 percent risk weight, with one exception. If the banking\\norganization applied the full look-through approach to calculate risk-weighted assets for the\\nequity exposure to the investment fund at the previous layer, the banking organization would be\\nrequired to apply the full-look through approach to any subsequent layer when there is sufficient\\nand frequent information provided to the banking organization regarding the underlying\\nexposures of that particular investment fund. If there is not sufficient and frequent information to\\napply the full look-through approach to the subsequent layer, then the banking organization\\nwould be required to assign a 1,250 percent risk weight to the subsequent layer.\\nQuestion 71: The agencies invite comment on the impact of the proposed expanded risk-\\nbased framework for equity exposures. What are the pros and cons of the proposal and what, if\\nany, unintended consequences might the proposed treatment pose with respect to a banking\\norganization\\'s equity exposures? Provide data to support the response.\\nQuestion 72: The agencies solicit comment on all aspects of the proposed treatment of\\nequity exposures to investment funds. What, if any, challenges could implementing the full look-\\nthrough approach, the alternative modified look-through approach, or the 1,250 percent risk\\nweight pose for banking organizations? What, if any, clarifications or modifications should the\\nagencies consider making to the proposed look-through approaches and why? To what extent\\nwould equity exposures to investment funds be captured under the proposed look-through\\nPage 184 of 1089\\napproaches in equity exposure framework as opposed to the market risk framework? Which\\ntype(s) of investment funds would present challenges under the proposed methods? What other\\nmethods should the agencies consider to more accurately capture such exposures\\' risk that\\nwould still help promote simplicity and transparency of risk-based capital requirements?\\nQuestion 73: What, if any, modifications should the agencies consider to more\\nappropriately capture the risk of underlying derivatives exposures held by an investment fund\\nand why? The agencies seek comment on the appropriateness of the proposed alternative method\\nfor banking organizations to calculate risk-weighted asset amounts for derivative exposures held\\nby an investment fund if the banking organization does not have sufficient information to use SA-\\nCCR. What would be the benefits and drawbacks of excluding derivative contracts that are used\\nfor hedging rather than speculative purposes and that do not constitute a material portion of the\\ninvestment entity\\'s exposures?\\nF. Operational risk\\nThe proposal would introduce a capital requirement for operational risk based on a\\nstandardized approach (standardized approach for operational risk). The current capital rule\\ndefines operational risk as the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes,\\npeople, and systems, or from external events. Operational risk includes legal risk but excludes\\nstrategic and reputational risk. \\xc2\\xb975 Experience shows that operational risk is inherent in all\\nbanking products, activities, processes, and systems.\\nUnder the current capital rule, banking organizations subject to Category I or II capital\\nstandards are required to calculate risk-weighted assets for operational risk using the advanced\\n175\\nSee 12 CFR 3.101 (OCC), 217.101 (Board), and 12 CFR 324.101 (FDIC).\\nPage 185 of 1089\\nmeasurement approaches (AMA), 1\\xc2\\xb976 which are based on a banking organization\\'s internal\\nmodels. The AMA results in significant challenges for banking organizations, market\\nparticipants, and the supervisory process. AMA exposure estimates can present substantial\\nuncertainty and volatility, which introduces challenges to capital planning processes. \\xc2\\xb977 In\\naddition, the AMA\\'s reliance on internal models has resulted in a lack of transparency and\\ncomparability across banking organizations. As a result, supervisors and market participants\\nexperience challenges in assessing the relative magnitude of operational risk across banking\\norganizations, evaluating the adequacy of operational risk capital, and determining the\\neffectiveness of operational risk management practices. To address these concerns, the proposal\\nwould remove the AMA and introduce a standardized approach for operational risk that seeks to\\naddress the operational risks currently covered by the AMA.\\nThe operational risk capital requirements under the standardized approach for operational\\nrisk would be a function of a banking organization\\'s business indicator component and internal\\noss multiplier. The business indicator component would provide a measure of the operational\\nrisk exposure of the banking organization and would be calculated based on its business indicator\\nmultiplied by scaling factors that increase with the business indicator. The business indicator\\nwould serve as a proxy for a banking organization\\'s business volume and would be based on\\ninputs compiled from a banking organization\\'s financial statements. The internal loss multiplier\\n176\\nThe agencies adopted the AMA for operational risk as part of the advanced approaches capital\\nframework in 2007. See 72 FR 69288 (December 7, 2007).\\n177\\nSee, e.g., Cope, E., G. Mignola, G. Antonini, and R. Ugoccioni. 2009. Challenges and Pitfalls\\nin Measuring Operational Risk from Loss Data.

To help ensure the robustness of the operational risk capital\\nrequirement, the proposal would require that the internal loss multiplier be no less than one.\\nA banking organization\\'s operational risk capital requirement would be equal to its\\nbusiness indicator component multiplied by its internal loss multiplier. Similar to the current\\ncapital rule, risk-weighted assets for operational risk would be equal to 12.5 times the operational\\nrisk capital requirement.\\n1. Business indicator\\nUnder the proposal, the business indicator would be based on the sum of the following\\nthree components: an interest, lease, and dividend component; a services component; and a\\nfinancial component. Each component would serve as a measure of a broad category of activities\\nin which banking organizations typically engage. Given that operational risk is inherent in all\\nbanking products, activities, processes, and systems, these components aim to capture\\ncomprehensively the volume of a banking organization\\'s financial activities and thus serve as a\\nproxy for a banking organization\\'s business volume. The interest, lease, and dividend component\\naims to capture lending and investment activities through measures of interest income, interest\\nexpense, interest-earning assets, and dividends. The services component aims to capture fee and\\ncommission-based activities as well as other banking activities, such as those resulting in other\\noperating income and other operating expense. Lastly, the financial component aims to capture\\ntrading activity and other activities that are associated with a banking organization\\'s assets and\\nliabilities.\\nPage 187 of 1089\\nBanking organizations with higher overall business volume are larger and more complex,\\nwhich likely results in exposure to higher operational risk.178 Higher business volumes present\\nmore opportunities for operational risk to manifest. In addition, the complexities associated with\\na higher business volume can give rise to gaps or other deficiencies in internal controls that result\\nin operational losses. Therefore, higher overall business volume would correlate with higher\\noperational risk capital requirements under the proposal.\\nUnder the proposal, all inputs to the business indicator would be based on three-year\\nrolling averages. For example, when calculating the three-year average for a business indicator\\ninput reported at the end of the third calendar quarter of 2023, the values of the item for the\\nfourth quarter of 2020 through the third quarter of 2021, the fourth quarter of 2021 through the\\nthird quarter of 2022, and the fourth quarter of 2022 through the third quarter of 2023 would be\\naveraged. The one exception is interest-earning assets, which would be calculated as the average\\nof the quarterly values of interest-earning assets for the previous 12 quarters.\\n178\\n179\\nRecent research connecting operational risk to higher business volume includes Frame,\\nMcLemore, and Mihov (2020), Haste Makes Waste: Banking Organization Growth and\\nOperational Risk, Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas,\\nhttps://www.dallasfed.org/research/papers/2020/wp2023; Curti, Frame, and Mihov (2019), Are\\nthe Largest Banking Organizations Operationally More Risky?, Journal of Money, Credit and\\nBanking Vol. 54, Issue 5, 1223-1259, https://doi.org/10.1111/jmcb.12933; and Abdymomunov\\nand Curti (2020), Quantifying and Stress Testing Operational Risk with Peer Banks\\' Data,\\nJournal of Financial Services Research Vol. 57, 287-313,\\nhttps://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10693-019-00320-w.\\n179 Unlike the other inputs used to calculate the business indicator, interest-earning assets are\\nbalance-sheet items, rather than income statement items, and thus their use in the business\\nindicator does not represent a flow over a one-year period, but rather a point-in-time value. The\\nuse of average interest-earning assets for the previous 12 quarters instead of, for example, the\\naverage interest-earning assets for the ending quarter of the last three years aims to increase the\\nrobustness of the average used in the calculation.\\nPage 188 of 1089\\nThe use of three-year averages would capture a banking organization\\'s activities over\\ntime and help reduce the impact of temporary fluctuations. Basing the business indicator on a\\nshorter time period, such as a single year of data, would likely result in a more volatile capital\\nrequirement, which could make it more difficult for banking organizations to incorporate the\\noperational risk capital requirement into capital planning processes and could result in unduly\\nlow or high operational risk capital requirements given temporary changes in a banking\\norganization\\'s activities. Alternatively, basing the business indicator on too many years of data\\ncould reduce its responsiveness to changes in a banking organization\\'s activities, which could in\\nturn weaken the relationship between the capital requirements and the banking organization\\'s\\nrisk profile. Based on these considerations, the use of three-year averages aims to balance the\\nstability and responsiveness of a banking organization\\'s operational risk capital requirement.\\nAs described below, the inputs used in each component of the business indicator would,\\nin most cases, use information contained in line items from schedules RI and RC of the Call\\nReport and schedules HI and HC of the FR Y-9C report, as applicable. The agencies are planning\\nto separately propose modifications to the FFIEC 101 report so that all inputs to the business\\nindicator (described below) as well as total net operational losses (described further below)\\nwould be publicly reported as separate inputs to the applicable calculations.\\nThe inputs to each component of the business indicator would not be meant to overlap.\\nIncome and expenses would not be counted in more than one component of the business\\nindicator, consistent with instructions to the regulatory reports and the principles of accounting.\\nThe inputs used to calculate the business indicator would include data relative to entities\\nthat have been acquired by, or merged with, the banking organization over the period prior to the\\nacquisition or merger that is relevant to the calculation of the business indicator.\\nPage 189 of 1089\\na.

Net interest income is a useful indicator of a banking organization\\'s\\noperational risk because a higher volume of business is associated with higher operational risk.\\nBecause operational risk does not necessarily increase proportionally to increases in net interest\\nincome, the net interest income input would be capped at 2.25 percent of interest-earning assets.\\nThe proposal would add dividend income to the net interest income input to capture\\ninvestment activities that do not produce interest income (for example, investment in equities and\\nmutual funds).\\nb. The services component\\n183 Interest-earning assets would equal the sum of interest-bearing balances in U.S. offices,\\ninterest-bearing balances in foreign offices, Edge and agreement subsidiaries, and IBFs, federal\\nfunds sold in domestic offices, securities purchased under agreements to resell, loans and leases\\nheld for sale, loans and leases, held for investment, total held-to-maturity securities at amortized\\ncost (only including securities that pay interest), total available-for-sale securities at fair value\\n(only including securities that pay interest), and total trading assets (only including trading assets\\nthat pay interest) in the FR Y-9C (holding companies) and Call Report.\\nPage 191 of 1089\\nUnder the proposal, the services component would account for activities that result in\\nfees and commissions and other financial activities not captured by the other components of the\\nbusiness indicator. The services component would be calculated as follows:\\nServices component\\n= max (Avg3y (fee and commission income), Avg3y(fee and commission expense))\\n+ max (Avg3y (other operating income), Avg3y (other operating expense))\\nThe proposal includes the following definitions:\\n\\xe2\\x97\\x8f\\n\\xe2\\x97\\x8f\\nFee and commission income would mean income received from providing advisory\\nand financial services, including insurance income; \\xc2\\xb984\\nFee and commission expense would mean expenses paid by the banking organization\\nfor advisory and financial services received;\\xc2\\xb9\\n185\\n184\\nFee and commission income would include the sum of income from fiduciary activities,\\nservice charges on deposit accounts in domestic offices; fees and commissions from securities\\nbrokerage; investment banking, advisory, and underwriting fees and commissions; fees and\\ncommissions from annuity sales; income and fees from printing and sale of checks; income and\\nfees from automated teller machines; safe deposit box rent; bank card and credit card interchange\\nfees; income and fees from wire transfers; underwriting income from insurance and reinsurance\\nactivities; and income from other insurance activities in the FR Y-9C (holding companies) and\\nCall Report. Fee and commission income would also include servicing fees on a gross basis,\\nwhich would correspond to net servicing fees in the FR Y-9C (holding companies) and Call\\nReport, with the modification that expenses should not be netted, because fee and commission\\nexpenses should not be netted in the calculation of fee and commission income. In addition, fee\\nand commission income would include other income received from providing advice and\\nfinancial services that is not currently itemized in the regulatory reports.\\n185 Fee and commission expense would include consulting and advisory expenses and automated\\nteller machine and interchange expenses in the FR Y-9C (holding companies) and Call Report.\\nFee and commission expense would also include any other expenses paid for advice and\\nfinancial services received that are not currently itemized in the regulatory reports.\\nPage 192 of 1089\\n\\xe2\\x97\\x8f Other operating income would mean income not included in other elements of the\\nbusiness indicator and not excluded from the business indicator; 186\\n36 \\nand\\nOther operating expense would mean expenses associated with financial services not\\nincluded in other elements of the business indicator and all expenses associated with\\noperational loss events (expenses associated with operational loss events would not\\nbe included in other business indicator items). 187 Other operating expense would not\\ninclude expenses excluded from the business indicator.\\n\\xe2\\x97\\x8f\\nThe services component would reflect a banking organization\\'s income and expenses\\nfrom fees and commissions as well as its other operating income and expenses.\\nThe fee and commission elements and the other operating elements of the services\\ncomponent would be calculated as gross amounts, reflecting the larger of either income or\\nexpense. This approach would account for the different business models of banking\\norganizations better than a netting approach, which may lead to variances in the services\\ncomponent that exaggerate differences in operational risk. For example, using income net of\\nexpense as the indicator would result in the services component for banking organizations that\\nonly distribute products bought from third parties, for which expenses would be netted from\\nNote that fee and commission expense would include fees paid by the banking organization as a\\nresult of outsourcing financial services, but not fees paid for outsourced non-financial services\\n(e.g., logistical, information technology, human resources).\\n186\\nOther operating income would include rent and other income from other real estate owned in\\nthe FR Y-9C (holding companies) and Call Report. Other operating income would also include\\nall other income items not currently itemized in the regulatory reports, which are not included in\\nother business indicator items and are not specifically excluded from the business indicator.\\n187\\nNote that expenses with operational loss events in \"other operating expense\" would not\\nexclude expenses associated with operational loss events that result in less than $20,000 in net\\nloss amount.\\nPage 193 of 1089\\nincome, being substantially lower than the services component of banking organizations that\\noriginate products to distribute, which would generally not have many financial expenses to net\\nfrom income. Therefore, a netting approach would likely exaggerate the difference in operational\\nrisk between these two business models.\\nThe proposal would include in the services component the income and expense of a banking\\norganization\\'s insurance activities. The agencies intend for the operational risk capital\\nrequirement to reflect all operational risks to which a banking organization is exposed, regardless\\nof the activity or legal entity in which the operational risk resides.\\nQuestion 74: What are the advantages and disadvantages of the proposed approach to\\ncalculating the services component, including any impacts on specific business models? Which\\nalternatives, if any, should the agencies consider and why? Similarly, should the agencies\\nconsider any adjustments or limits related to specific business lines, such as underwriting,\\nwealth management, or custody, or to specific fee types, such as interchange fees, and if so what\\nadjustment or limits should they consider? For example, should the agencies consider adjusting\\nor limiting how the services component contributes to the business indicator and, if so, how?\\nWhat would be the advantages and disadvantages of any alternative approach and what impact\\nwould such an alternative approach have on operational risk capital requirements? For\\nexample, under the proposal, fee income and expenses of charge cards are included under the\\nservices component. Would it be more appropriate for fee income and expenses of charge cards\\nto be included in net interest income of the interest, lease, and dividend component (and\\nexcluded from the services component) and for charge card exposures to be included in interest\\nearning assets of the interest, lease, and dividend component and why? Please provide\\nsupporting data with your response.\\nPage 194 of 1089\\nC.\\nThe financial component\\nUnder the proposal, the financial component would capture trading activities and other\\nactivities associated with a banking organization\\'s assets and liabilities. The financial component\\nwould be calculated as follows:\\nFinancial component\\n= Avg3y (Abs (trading revenue))\\n+ Avg3y(Abs(net profit or loss on assets and liabilities not held for trading))\\nThe proposal includes the following definitions:\\n\\xe2\\x97\\x8f\\nTrading revenue would mean the net gain or loss from trading cash instruments and\\nderivative contracts (including commodity contracts);\\xc2\\xb9 and\\n188\\nNet profit or loss on assets and liabilities not held for trading would mean the sum of\\nrealized gains (losses) on held-to-maturity securities, realized gains (losses) on\\navailable-for-sale securities, net gains (losses) on sales of loans and leases, net gains\\n(losses) on sales of other real estate owned, net gains (losses) on sales of other assets,\\nventure capital revenue, net securitization income, and mark-to-market profit or loss\\non bank liabilities. 189\\n188 Trading revenue would correspond to trading revenue in the FR Y-9C (holding companies)\\nand Call Report.\\n189\\nRealized gains (losses) on held-to-maturity securities, realized gains (losses) on available-for-\\nsale securities, net gains (losses) on sales of loans and leases, net gains (losses) on sales of other\\nreal estate owned, net gains (losses) on sales of other assets, venture capital revenue, and net\\nsecuritization income correspond to their current definitions in the FR Y-9C (holding companies)\\nand Call Report.\\nPage 195 of 1089\\nThe financial component aims to capture trading activities and other activities that are\\nassociated with a banking organization\\'s assets and liabilities. Trading revenue, which reflects\\nnet income or loss from trading activities, would be a proxy for the business volume associated\\nwith trading and related activities. Net profit or loss on assets and liabilities not held for trading\\nwould reflect the profit or loss of activities associated with assets and liabilities that are not\\nincluded by other components of the business indicator and therefore ensures that the business\\nindicator comprehensively captures these activities. The use of net values for these inputs would\\nalign with current regulatory reporting, thereby reducing data gathering and calculation burden.\\nBoth of these inputs would be measured in terms of their absolute value to better capture\\nbusiness volume (for example, negative trading revenue would not imply that a banking\\norganization\\'s trading activities are small in volume), which is associated with higher operational\\nrisk.\\nd. Exclusions from the business indicator\\nUnder the proposal, the business indicator would reflect the volume of financial activities\\nof a banking organization; therefore, the business indicator would exclude expenses that do not\\nrelate to financial services received by the banking organization. Excluded expenses would\\ninclude staff expenses, expenses to outsource non-financial services (such as logistical, human\\nresources, and information technology), administrative expenses (such as utilities,\\ntelecommunications, travel, office supplies, and postage), expenses relating to premises and\\nfixed assets, and depreciation of tangible and intangible assets. Still, the proposal would include\\nexpenses related to operational loss events in the services component even when they relate to\\nthese otherwise-excluded categories of expenses because the objective of the operational risk\\ncapital requirement is to support a banking organization\\'s resilience to operational risk, and\\nPage 196 of 1089\\nobserved operational loss expenses are a meaningful indicator of a banking organization\\'s\\nexposure to operational risk.\\nThe proposal also would not include loss provisions and reversal of provisions (except\\nfor those related to operational loss events) or changes in goodwill in the business indicator, as\\nthese items do not reflect business volume of the banking organization. In addition, the business\\nindicator would not include applicable income taxes as an expense, as they reflect obligations to\\nthe government for which the operational risk capital framework should be neutral.\\nWith prior supervisory approval, the proposal would allow banking organizations to\\nexclude activities that they have ceased to conduct, whether directly or indirectly, from the\\ncalculation of the business indicator, provided that the banking organization demonstrates that\\nsuch activities do not carry legacy legal exposure. Supervisory approval would not be granted\\nwhen, for example, legacy business activities are subject to potential or pending legal or\\nregulatory enforcement action. The supervisory approval requirement would help ensure that a\\nbanking organization\\'s operational risk capital requirement aligns with its existing operational\\nrisk exposure.\\n2. Business indicator component\\nUnder the proposal, the business indicator component would be a function of the business\\nindicator, with three linear segments. The business indicator component would increase at a rate\\nof: (a) 12 percent per unit of business indicator for levels of business indicator up to $1 billion;\\n(b) 15 percent per unit of business indicator for levels of business indicator above $1 billion and\\nup to $30 billion; and (c) 18 percent per unit of business indicator for levels of business indicator\\nPage 197 of 1089\\nabove $30 billion. The table below presents the formulas that can be used to calculate the\\nbusiness indicator component given a banking organization\\'s business indicator.\\nBusiness indicator range\\n$0 to $1 billion\\n> $1 billion to $30 billion\\n> $30 billion\\nThe higher rate of increase of the business indicator component as a banking\\norganization\\'s business indicator rises above $1 billion and $30 billion would reflect exposure to\\noperational risk generally increasing more than proportionally with a banking organization\\'s\\noverall business volume, in part due to the increased complexity of large banking organizations.\\nThis approach is supported by analysis undertaken by the Basel Committee. \\xc2\\xb9\\xe2\\x81\\xb9\\xc2\\xb9 Similarly,\\nacademic studies have found that larger U.S. bank holding companies have higher operational\\nlosses per dollar of total assets.\\n192\\nBusiness indicator component \\xc2\\xb9\\xe2\\x81\\xb90\\n0.12 * Business Indicator (BI)\\n$120 million + 0.15 * (BI - $1 billion)\\n$4.47 billion + 0.18 * (BI - $30 billion)\\n3.

Supervisory experience also suggests that operational risk management deficiencies\\ncan be persistent, which can often result in operational losses. Accordingly, under the proposal,\\nthe operational risk capital requirement would be higher for banking organizations that\\nexperienced larger operational losses in the past. To this effect, the proposal would include a\\nscalar, the internal loss multiplier, that increases operational risk capital requirements based on a\\nbanking organization\\'s historical operational loss experience. This multiplier would depend on\\nthe ratio of a banking organization\\'s average annual total net operational losses to its business\\nindicator component.\\n193\\nThe proposal would require the internal loss multiplier to be no less than one. This floor\\nwould ensure that the operational risk capital requirement provides a robust minimum amount of\\ncoverage to the potential future operational risks a banking organization may be exposed to, as\\nreflected by its overall business volume through the business indicator component, even in\\nsituations where historical operational losses have been low in relative terms.\\nThe internal loss multiplier would be calculated as follows:\\nInternal Loss Multiplier\\n{1, in (exp(1\\n= maximum 1, In\\nexp(1) \\xe2\\x80\\x93 1\\n15 x Average Annual Total Net Operational Losses\\nBusiness Indicator Component\\n0.8\\n193 See Curti and Migueis (2023), \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe Information Value of Past Losses in Operational Risk,\\nFinance and Economics Discussion Series,\" Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System,\\nhttps://doi.org/10.17016/FEDS.2023.003.\\nPage 199 of 1089\\nWhere:\\nAverage annual total net operational losses would correspond to the average of annual\\ntotal net operational losses over the previous ten years (on a rolling quarter basis).\\xc2\\xb9\\xe2\\x81\\xb94 In\\nthis calculation, the total net operational losses of a quarter would equal the sum of any\\nportions of losses or recoveries of any material operational losses allocated to the\\nquarter. Material operational loss would mean an operational loss incurred by the\\nbanking organization that resulted in a net loss greater than or equal to $20,000 after\\ntaking into account all subsequent recoveries related to the operational loss.\\nExp(1) is the Euler\\'s number, which is approximately equal to 2.7183.\\nIn is the natural logarithm.\\nAverage annual total net operational losses would be multiplied by 15 in the internal loss\\nmultiplier formula. This multiplication extrapolates from average annual total net operational\\nlosses the potential for unusually large losses and, therefore, aims to ensure that a banking\\norganization maintains sufficient capital given its operational loss history and risk profile. The\\nconstant used is consistent with the Basel III reforms.\\nThe natural log function (ln) combined with an exponent of 0.8 would limit the effect that\\nlarge operational losses have on a banking organization\\'s operational risk capital requirement.\\nThis feature of the internal loss multiplier formula is intended to constrain the volatility of the\\n194\\nFor example, when calculating average annual total net operational losses for the second\\ncalendar quarter of 2023, total net operational losses from the third calendar quarter of 2013\\nthrough the second calendar quarter of 2023 would be included.\\nPage 200 of 1089\\noperational risk capital requirement. As a result, increases in average annual total net operational\\nlosses would increase the operational risk capital requirement at a decreasing rate.195\\nThe calculation of average annual total net operational losses would be based on an\\naverage of ten years of data. The use of a ten-year average for annual total net operational losses\\nwould balance recognition that a banking organization\\'s operational risk exposure changes over\\ntime with limiting the volatility that would result from using a shorter time horizon and the\\nimportance of the calculation window providing sufficient information regarding the banking\\norganization\\'s operational risk profile.\\nThe proposal would define an \"operational loss\\xe2\\x80\\x9d as all losses (excluding insurance or tax\\neffects) resulting from an operational loss event, including any reduction in previously reported\\ncapital levels attributable to restatements or corrections of financial statements. An operational\\nloss includes all expenses associated with an operational loss event except for opportunity costs,\\nforgone revenue, and costs related to risk management and control enhancements implemented\\nto prevent future operational losses. Operational loss would not include losses that are also credit\\nlosses and are related to exposures within the scope of the credit risk risk-weighted assets\\nframework (except for retail credit card losses arising from non-contractual, third-party-initiated\\nfraud, which are operational losses).\\n195 The internal loss multiplier variation depends on the ratio of the product of 15 and the average\\nannual total operational losses to the business indicator component. The 0.8 exponent applied to\\nthis ratio reduces the effect of the variation of this ratio on the internal loss multiplier. For\\nexample, a ratio of 2 becomes approximately 1.74 after application of the exponent, and a ratio\\nof 0.5 becomes approximately 0.57 after application of the exponent. Similarly, the application\\nof a logarithmic function further reduces the variability of the internal loss multiplier for values\\nabove 1. Taken together, these two transformations mitigate the reaction of the operational risk\\ncapital requirement to large historical operational losses.\\nPage 201 of 1089\\n\"Operational loss event\" would be defined as an event that results in loss due to\\ninadequate or failed internal processes, people, or systems or from external events. This\\ndefinition includes legal loss events and restatements or corrections of financial statements that\\nresult in a reduction of capital relative to amounts previously reported. The proposal would retain\\nthe current classification of operational loss events according to seven event types:\\n1 \\xc2\\xb7 Internal fraud, which means the operational loss event type that comprises operational\\nlosses resulting from an act involving at least one internal party of a type intended to defraud,\\nmisappropriate property, or circumvent regulations, the law, or company policy excluding\\ndiversity and discrimination noncompliance events.\\n2 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 External fraud, which means the operational loss event type that comprises\\noperational losses resulting from an act by a third party of a type intended to defraud,\\nmisappropriate property, or circumvent the law. Retail credit card losses arising from non-\\ncontractual, third-party-initiated fraud (for example, identity theft) are external fraud operational\\nlosses.\\n3 - Employment practices and workplace safety, which means the operational loss event\\ntype that comprises operational losses resulting from an act inconsistent with employment,\\nhealth, or safety laws or agreements, payment of personal injury claims, or payment arising from\\ndiversity and discrimination noncompliance events.\\n4 - Clients, products, and business practices, which means the operational loss event type\\nthat comprises operational losses resulting from the nature or design of a product or from an\\nunintentional or negligent failure to meet a professional obligation to specific clients (including\\nfiduciary and suitability requirements).\\nPage 202 of 1089\\n5 - Damage to physical assets, which means the operational loss event type that\\ncomprises operational losses resulting from the loss of or damage to physical assets from natural\\ndisasters or other events.\\n6 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Business disruption and system failures, which means the operational loss event type\\nthat comprises operational losses resulting from disruption of business or system failures,\\nincluding hardware, software, telecommunications, or utility outage or disruptions.\\n7- Execution, delivery, and process management, which means the operational loss\\nevent type that comprises operational losses resulting from failed transaction processing or\\nprocess management or losses arising from relations with trade counterparties and vendors.\\nBy ensuring consistency, the classification of operational loss events according to these\\nevent types would continue to assist banking organizations and the agencies in understanding the\\ncausal factors driving operational losses.\\nThe proposal would include a $20,000 net loss threshold (that is, $20,000 after taking\\ninto account all subsequent recoveries related to the operational loss) for inclusion of an\\noperational loss in the calculation of average annual total net operational losses. This threshold\\naims to balance comprehensiveness against the materiality of the operational losses.\\nThe proposal would require a banking organization to group losses with a common\\nunderlying trigger into the same operational loss event. For example, losses that occur in\\nmultiple locations or over a period of time resulting from the same natural disaster would be\\ngrouped into a single operational loss event. This grouping requirement aims to ensure\\ncomprehensive inclusion of operational loss events that result in $20,000 or more of net loss in\\nPage 203 of 1089'\n",
