ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking.
SUMMARY: The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Board of Governors of the
Federal Reserve System, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation are inviting public
comment on a notice of proposed rulemaking (proposal) that would substantially revise the
capital requirements applicable to large banking organizations and to banking organizations with
significant trading activity. The revisions set forth in the proposal would improve the calculation
of risk-based capital requirements to better reflect the risks of these banking organizations'
Page 1 of 1089
exposures, reduce the complexity of the framework, enhance the consistency of requirements
across these banking organizations, and facilitate more effective supervisory and market
assessments of capital adequacy. The revisions would include replacing current requirements that
include the use of banking organizations' internal models for credit risk and operational risk with
standardized approaches and replacing the current market risk and credit valuation adjustment
risk requirements with revised approaches. The proposed revisions would be generally consistent
with recent changes to international capital standards issued by the Basel Committee on Banking
Supervision. The proposal would not amend the capital requirements applicable to smaller, less
complex banking organizations.

I.
Introduction
The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), the Board of Governors of the
Federal Reserve System (Board), and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC)
(collectively, the agencies) are proposing to modify the capital requirements applicable to
banking organizations¹ with total assets of $100 billion or more and their subsidiary depository
institutions (large banking organizations) and to banking organizations with significant trading
activity. The revisions set forth in the proposal would strengthen the calculation of risk-based
capital requirements to better reflect the risks of these banking organizations' exposures. In
addition, the proposed revisions would enhance the consistency of requirements across large
banking organizations and facilitate more effective supervisory and market assessments of
capital adequacy.
Following the 2007-09 financial crisis, the agencies adopted an initial set of reforms to
improve the effectiveness of and address weaknesses in the regulatory capital framework. For
example, in 2013, the agencies adopted a final rule that increased the quantity and quality of
regulatory capital banking organizations must maintain.² These changes were broadly consistent
1 The term “banking organizations” includes national banks, state member banks, state
nonmember banks, federal savings associations, state savings associations, top-tier bank holding
companies domiciled in the United States not subject to the Board's Small Bank Holding
Company and Savings and Loan Holding Company Policy Statement (12 CFR part 225,
appendix C), U.S. intermediate holding companies of foreign banking organizations, and top-tier
savings and loan holding companies domiciled in the United States, except for certain savings
and loan holding companies that are substantially engaged in insurance underwriting or
commercial activities and savings and loan holding companies that are subject to the Small Bank
Holding Company and Savings and Loan Holding Company Policy Statement.
2 The Board and the OCC issued a joint final rule on October 11, 2013 (78 FR 62018) and the
FDIC issued a substantially identical interim final rule on September 10, 2013 (78 FR 55340). In
April 2014, the FDIC adopted the interim final rule as a final rule with no substantive changes.
79 FR 20754 (April 14, 2014).

with an initial set of reforms published by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel
Committee) following the financial crisis.³ The Board also implemented capital planning and
stress testing requirements for large bank holding companies and savings and loan holding
companies and an additional capital buffer requirement to mitigate the financial stability risks
posed by U.S. global systemically important banking organizations (GSIBs),5 as well as other
enhanced prudential standards, consistent with the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and
Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (Dodd-Frank Act)."
The proposal would build on these initial reforms by making additional changes
developed in response to the 2007-09 financial crisis and informed by experience since the crisis.
Requirements under the proposal would generally be consistent with international capital
standards issued by the Basel Committee, commonly known as the Basel III reforms.7 Where
appropriate, the proposal differs from the Basel III reforms to reflect, for example, specific
characteristics of U.S. markets, requirements under U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles (GAAP), practices of U.S. banking organizations, and U.S. legal requirements and
policy objectives.
The proposal would strengthen risk-based capital requirements for large banking
organizations by improving their comprehensiveness and risk sensitivity. These proposed

authorities, which was established by the central bank governors of the G-10 countries in 1975.

Page 11 of 1089
revisions, including removal of certain internal models, would increase capital requirements in
the aggregate, in particular for those banking organizations with heightened risk profiles.
Increased capital requirements can produce both economic costs and benefits. The agencies
assessed the likely effect of the proposal on economic activity and resilience, and expect that the
benefits of strengthening capital requirements for large banking organizations outweigh the
costs.⁹
Historical experience has demonstrated the impact individual banking organizations can
have on the stability of the U.S. banking system, in particular banking organizations that would
have been subject to the proposal. Large banking organizations that experience an increase in
their capital requirements resulting from the proposal would be expected to be able to absorb
losses with reduced disruption to financial intermediation in the U.S. economy. Enhanced
resilience of the banking sector supports more stable lending through the economic cycle and
diminishes the likelihood of financial crises and their associated costs.
The agencies seek comment on all aspects of the proposal.
A. Overview of the proposal
The proposal would improve the risk capture and consistency of capital requirements
across large banking organizations and reduce complexity and operational costs through changes
across multiple areas of the agencies' risk-based capital framework. For most parts of the
framework, the proposal would eliminate the use of banking organizations' internal models to set
regulatory capital requirements and in their place apply a simpler and more consistent
standardized framework. For market risk, the proposal would retain banking organizations'
9 See the impact and economic analysis presented in section V of this Supplementary
Information.
Page 12 of 1089
ability to use internal models, with an improved models-based measure for market risk that better
accounts for potential losses. The use of internal models would be subject to enhanced
requirements for model approval and performance and a new "output floor" to limit the extent to
which a banking organization's internal models may reduce its overall capital requirement. The
proposal would also adopt new standardized approaches for market risk and credit valuation
adjustment (CVA) risk that better reflect the risks of banking organizations' exposures.
This new framework for calculating risk-weighted assets (the expanded risk-based
approach) would apply to banking organizations with total assets of $100 billion or more and
their subsidiary depository institutions. The revised requirements for market risk would also
apply to other banking organizations with $5 billion or more in trading assets plus trading
liabilities or for which trading assets plus trading liabilities exceed 10 percent of total assets.
The expanded risk-based approach would be more risk-sensitive than the current U.S.
standardized approach by incorporating more credit-risk drivers (for example, borrower and loan
characteristics) and explicitly differentiating between more types of risk (for example,
operational risk, credit valuation adjustment risk). In this manner, the expanded risk-based
approach would better account for key risks faced by large banking organizations. The proposed
changes would also enhance the alignment of capital requirements to the risks of banking
organizations' exposures and increase incentives for prudent risk management.
To ensure that large banking organizations would not have lower capital requirements
than smaller, less complex banking organizations, the proposal would maintain the capital rule's
dual-requirement structure. Under this structure, a large banking organization would be required
to calculate its risk-based capital ratios under both the new expanded risk-based approach and the
standardized approach (including market risk, as applicable), and use the lower of the two for
Page 13 of 1089
10
each risk-based capital ratio. ¹0 All capital buffer requirements, including the stress capital buffer
requirement, would apply regardless of whether the expanded risk-based approach or the existing
standardized approach produces the lower ratio.
For banking organizations subject to Category III or IV capital standards,¹¹ the proposal
would align the calculation of regulatory capital – the numerator of the regulatory capital ratios —
with the calculation for banking organizations subject to Category I or II capital standards,
providing the same approach for all large banking organizations. Banking organizations subject
to Category III or IV capital standards would be subject to the same treatment of accumulated
other comprehensive income (AOCI), capital deductions, and rules for minority interest as
banking organizations subject to Category I or II capital standards. This change would help
ensure that the regulatory capital ratios of these banking organizations better reflect their
capacity to absorb losses, including by taking into account unrealized losses or gains on
securities positions reflected in AOCI.
10 Banking organizations' risk-based capital ratios are the common equity tier 1 capital ratio,
tier 1 capital ratio, and total capital ratio. See 12 CFR 3.10 (OCC), 12 CFR 217.10 (Board), and
12 CFR 324.10 (FDIC).
11 In 2019, the agencies adopted rules establishing four categories of capital standards for U.S.
banking organizations with $100 billion or more in total assets and foreign banking organizations
with $100 billion or more in combined U.S. assets. Under this framework, Category I capital
standards apply to U.S. global systemically important bank holding companies and their
depository institution subsidiaries. Category II capital standards apply to banking organizations
with at least $700 billion in total consolidated assets or at least $75 billion in cross-jurisdictional
activity and their depository institution subsidiaries. Category III capital standards apply to
banking organizations with total consolidated assets of at least $250 billion or at least $75 billion
in weighted short-term wholesale funding, nonbank assets, or off-balance sheet exposure and
their depository institution subsidiaries. Category IV capital standards apply to banking
organizations with total consolidated assets of at least $100 billion that do not meet the
thresholds for a higher category and their depository institution subsidiaries. See 12 CFR 3.2
(OCC), 12 CFR 252.5, 12 CFR 238.10 (Board), 12 CFR 324.2 (FDIC); “Prudential Standards for
Large Bank Holding Companies, Savings and Loan Holding Companies, and Foreign Banking
Organizations," 84 FR 59032 (November 1, 2019); and "Changes to Applicability Thresholds for
Regulatory Capital and Liquidity Requirements," 84 FR 59230 (November 1, 2019).
Page 14 of 1089
The proposal would expand application of the supplementary leverage ratio and the
countercyclical capital buffer to banking organizations subject to Category IV capital standards.
This change would bring further alignment of capital requirements across large banking
organizations and is consistent with the proposal's goal of strengthening the resilience of large
banking organizations.
The proposal would also introduce enhanced disclosure requirements to facilitate market
participants' understanding of a banking organization's financial condition and risk management
practices. Also, the proposal would align Federal Reserve's regulatory reporting requirements
with the changes to capital requirements. The agencies anticipate that revisions to the reporting
forms of the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC) applicable to large
banking organizations and to banking organizations with significant trading activity will be
proposed in the near future, which would align with the proposed revisions to the capital rule.
The proposed changes would take effect subject to the transition provisions described in
section IV of this Supplementary Information.
The revisions introduced by the proposal would interact with several Board rules,
including by modifying the risk-weighted assets used to calculate total loss-absorbing capacity
requirements, long-term debt requirements, and the short-term wholesale funding score included
in the GSIB surcharge method 2 score. Also, the proposal would revise the calculation of single-
counterparty credit limits by removing the option of using a banking organization's internal
models to calculate derivatives exposure amounts and requiring the use of the standardized
approach for counterparty credit risk for this purpose. The proposal would also remove the
exemption from calculating risk-weighted assets under subpart E of the capital rule currently
Page 15 of 1089
available to U.S. intermediate holding companies of foreign banking organizations under the
Board's enhanced prudential standards.
In parallel, the Board is issuing a notice of proposed rulemaking revising the GSIB
surcharge calculation applicable to GSIBs and the systemic risk report applicable to large
banking organizations.¹2
Question 1: The Board invites comment on the interaction of the revisions under the
proposal with other existing rules and with the other notice of proposed rulemaking. In
particular, comment is invited on the impact of the proposal on the single-counterparty credit
limit framework. What are the advantages and disadvantages of the proposed approach? Which
alternatives, if any, should the Board consider and why?
B. Use of internal models under the proposed framework
The proposal would remove the use of internal models to set credit risk and operational
risk capital requirements (the so-called advanced approaches) for banking organizations subject
to Category I or II capital standards. These internal models rely on a banking organization's
choice of modeling assumptions and supporting data. Such model assumptions include a degree
of subjectivity, which can result in varying risk-based capital requirements for similar exposures.
Moreover, empirical verification of modeling choices can require many years of historical
experience because severe credit risk and operational risk losses can occur infrequently. In the
agencies' previous observations, the advanced approaches have produced unwarranted variability
¹2 [On October 24, 2019, the Board published in the Federal Register a notice of proposed
rulemaking inviting comment on a proposal to establish risk-based capital requirements for
depository institution holding companies significantly engaged in insurance activities. See 84 FR
57240 (October 24, 2019). The Board anticipates that any final rule based on the proposal in this
Supplementary Information would include appropriate adjustments as necessary to take into
account any final insurance capital rule.]
Page 16 of 1089
across banking organizations in requirements for exposures with similar risks.¹³ This
unwarranted variability, combined with the complexity of these models-based approaches, can
reduce confidence in the validity of the modeled outputs, lessen the transparency of the risk-
based capital ratios, and challenge comparisons of capital adequacy across banking
organizations.
Standardization of credit and operational risk capital requirements would improve the
consistency of requirements. Standardized requirements, together with robust public disclosure
and reporting requirements, would enhance the transparency of capital requirements and the
ability of supervisors and market participants to make independent assessments of a banking
organization's capital adequacy, individually and relative to its peers.
The use of robust, risk-sensitive standardized approaches for credit and operational risk
would also improve the efficiency of the capital framework by reducing operational costs. Under
the advanced approaches, banking organizations subject to Category I or II capital standards
must develop and maintain internal modeling systems to determine capital requirements, which
may differ from the risk measurement approaches they use to monitor risk for internal
assessments. Further, any material changes to a banking organization's internal models must be
fully documented and presented to the banking organization's primary federal supervisor for
review.¹4 Replacing the use of internal models with standardized approaches would reduce costs
associated with maintaining such modeling systems and eliminate the associated submissions to
the agencies.

13 The Basel Committee has published analysis illustrating the variability of credit-risk-weighted
assets across banking organizations. See https://www.bis.org/publ/bcbs256.pdf and
https://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d363.pdf.

16
Eliminating the use of internal models to set credit and operational risk capital
requirements would not reduce the overall risk capture of the regulatory framework. In addition
to the calculation of expanded risk-based approach and standardized approach capital
requirements, a large banking organization would continue to be required to maintain capital
commensurate with the level and nature of all risks to which the banking organization is
exposed, ¹5 to have a process for assessing its overall capital adequacy in relation to its risk
profile and a comprehensive strategy for maintaining an appropriate level of capital,¹6 and, where
applicable, to conduct internal stress tests. ¹7 Also, holding companies subject to the Board's
capital plan rule would continue to be subject to a stress capital buffer requirement that is based
on a supervisory stress test of the holding company's exposures. ¹8 Although the proposal would
remove use of internal models for calculating capital requirements for credit and operational risk,
internal models can provide valuable information to a banking organization's internal stress
testing, capital planning, and risk management functions. Large banking organizations should
employ internal modeling capabilities as appropriate for the complexity of their activities.
17
18
The proposal would continue to allow use of internal models to set market risk capital
requirements for portfolios where modeling can be demonstrated to be appropriate. In addition,
the proposal would provide for conservative but risk-sensitive standardized alternatives where
modeling is not supported. In contrast to credit and operational risk, market risk data allows for
daily feedback on model performance to support empirical verification. The proposal would limit
the use of models to only those trading desks for which a banking organization has received

18
See 12 CFR 225.8 and 12 CFR 238.170.
Page 18 of 1089
approval from its primary federal supervisor. Ongoing use of such models would depend upon a
banking organization's ability to demonstrate through robust testing that the models are
sufficiently conservative and accurate for purposes of calculating market risk capital
requirements. In cases where a banking organization cannot demonstrate acceptable performance
of its internal models for a given trading desk, the banking organization would be required to use
the standardized measure for market risk which acts as a risk-sensitive alternative.
II. Scope of application
The proposal's expanded risk-based approach would apply to banking organizations with
total assets of $100 billion or more and their subsidiary depository institutions.¹9 These banking
organizations are large and exhibit heightened complexity. Application of the expanded risk-
based approach to large banking organizations would provide granular, generally standardized
requirements that result in robust risk capture and appropriate risk sensitivity. By strengthening
the requirements that apply to large banking organizations, the proposal would enhance their
resilience and reduce risks to U.S. financial stability and costs they may pose to the Federal
Deposit Insurance Fund in case of material distress or failure. Relative to smaller, less complex
banking organizations, these banking organizations have greater operational capacity to apply
more sophisticated requirements.
Previously, the agencies determined that the advanced approaches requirements should
not apply to banking organizations subject to Category III or IV capital standards, as the agencies
considered such requirements to be overly complex and burdensome relative to the safety and
19 The proposal would also apply to depository institutions with total assets of $100 billion or
more that are not consolidated subsidiaries of depository institution holding companies, and to
depository institutions with total assets of $100 billion or more that are subsidiaries of depository
institution holding companies that are not assigned a category under the capital rule.
Page 19 of 1089
soundness benefits that they would provide for these banking organizations.20 The expanded
risk-based approach generally is based on standardized requirements, which would be less
complex and costly. In addition, recent events demonstrate the impact banking organizations
subject to Category III or IV capital standards can have on financial stability. While the recent
failure of banking organizations subject to Category IV capital standards may be attributed to a
variety of factors, the effect of these failures on financial stability supports further alignment of
the regulatory capital framework across large banking organizations.
Banking organizations with significant trading activities are subject to substantial market
risk and, therefore, would be subject to market risk capital requirements. Recognizing that the
dollar-based threshold for the application of market risk requirements was established in 1996,
the proposal would increase this dollar-based threshold from $1 billion to $5 billion of trading
assets plus trading liabilities. Banking organizations would also continue to be subject to market
risk requirements if their trading assets plus trading liabilities represent 10 percent or more of
total assets. The proposal would revise the calculation of the dollar-based threshold amount to be
based on four-quarter averages of trading assets and trading liabilities instead of point-in-time
amounts. Banking organizations that would no longer meet these minimum thresholds for being
subject to market risk capital requirements would calculate risk-weighted assets for trading
exposures under the standardized approach. Additionally, under the proposal, large banking
organizations would be subject to market risk capital requirements regardless of trading
activities.
20 See “Prudential Standards for Large Bank Holding Companies, Savings and Loan Holding
Companies, and Foreign Banking Organizations," 84 FR 59032 (November 1, 2019).
Page 20 of 1089
The proposal would expand application of the countercyclical capital buffer to banking
organizations subject to Category IV capital standards. The countercyclical capital buffer is a
macroprudential tool that can be used to increase the resilience of the financial system by
increasing capital requirements for large banking organizations during a period of elevated risk
of above-normal losses. Failure or distress of a banking organization with assets of $100 billion
or more during a time of elevated risk or stress can have significant destabilizing effects for other
banking organizations and the broader financial system - even if the banking organization does
not meet the criteria for being subject to Category II or III capital standards. Applying the
countercyclical capital buffer to banking organizations subject to Category IV capital standards
would increase the resilience of these banking organizations and, in turn, improve the resilience
of the broader financial system. The proposed approach also has the potential to moderate
fluctuations in the supply of credit over time. The proposal would also modify how the
countercyclical capital buffer amount is determined to reflect the proposed changes to market
risk capital requirements. Specifically, the risk-weighted asset amount for private sector credit
exposures that are market risk covered positions under the proposal would be determined using
the standardized default risk capital requirement for such positions rather than using the specific
risk add-on of the current rule.
The proposal also would expand application of the supplementary leverage ratio
requirement to banking organizations subject to Category IV capital standards. In contrast to the
risk-based capital requirements, a leverage ratio does not differentiate the amount of capital
required by exposure type. Rather, a leverage ratio puts a simple and transparent limit on
banking organization leverage. Leverage requirements protect against underestimation of risk
both by banking organizations and by risk-based capital requirements and serve as a complement
Page 21 of 1089
to risk-based capital requirements. The supplementary leverage ratio measures tier 1 capital
relative to total leverage exposure, which includes on-balance sheet assets and certain off-
balance sheet exposures. The proposed change would ensure that all large banking organizations
are subject to a consistent and robust leverage requirement that serves as a complement to risk-
based capital requirements and takes into account on- and off-balance sheet exposures.
Question 2: What are the advantages and disadvantages of applying the expanded risk-
based approach to banking organizations subject to Category III or IV capital standards? To
what extent is the expanded risk-based approach appropriate for banking organizations with
different risk profiles, including from a cost and operational burden perspective? Are there
specific areas, such as the market risk capital framework, for which the agencies should consider
a materiality threshold to better balance cost and operational burden and risk sensitivity, and if
so what should that threshold be and why? What would the appropriate exposure treatment be
for banking organizations with such exposures beneath any materiality threshold, and how
would that treatment be consistent with the overall calibration of the expanded risk-based
approach? What alternatives, if any, should the agencies consider to help ensure that the risks of
large banking organizations are appropriately captured under minimum risk-based capital
requirements and why?
Question 3: What are the advantages and disadvantages of harmonizing the calculation
of regulatory capital across large banking organizations? What are any unintended
consequences of the proposal and what steps should the agencies consider to mitigate those
consequences? What are the advantages and disadvantages of harmonizing the calculation of
regulatory capital across large banking organizations and using different approaches (for
Page 22 of 1089
example, the expanded risk-based approach and the U.S. standardized approach) for the
calculation of risk-weighted assets?
Question 4: What are the advantages and disadvantages of applying the countercyclical
capital buffer and supplementary leverage ratio to banking organizations subject to Category IV
capital standards?
III. Proposed changes to the capital rule
A. Calculation of capital ratios and application of buffer requirements
Under the proposal, large banking organizations would be required to calculate total risk-
weighted assets under two approaches: (1) the expanded risk-based approach, and (2) the
standardized approach. Total risk-weighted assets under the expanded risk-based approach
(expanded total risk-weighted assets) would equal the sum of risk-weighted assets for credit risk,
equity risk, operational risk, market risk, and CVA risk, as described in this proposal, minus any
amount of the banking organization's adjusted allowance for credit losses that is not included in
tier 2 capital and any amount of allocated transfer risk reserves. For calculating standardized
total risk-weighted assets, the proposal would revise the methodology for determining market
risk-weighted assets and would require banking organizations subject to Category III or IV
capital standards to use the standardized approach for counterparty credit risk (SA-CCR) for
derivative exposures.
21
21 The proposed methodology for determining market risk-weighted assets, in certain instances,
would require a banking organization that is subject to subpart E to apply risk weights from
subpart D for purposes of determining its standardized total risk-weighted assets and from
subpart E for purposes of determining its expanded total risk-weighted assets. This approach
would apply in the case of: (i) capital add-ons for re-designations, (ii) term repo-style
transactions the banking organization elects to include in market risk, (iii) the standardized
default risk capital requirement for securitization positions non-CTP, and (iv) the standardized
default risk capital requirement for correlation trading positions, each as discussed further below.
Page 23 of 1089
To determine its applicable risk-based capital ratios, a large banking organization would
calculate two sets of risk-based capital ratios (common equity tier 1 capital ratio, tier 1 capital
ratio, and total capital ratio), one using expanded total risk-weighted assets and one using
standardized total risk-weighted assets. A banking organization's common equity tier 1 capital
ratio, tier 1 capital ratio, and total capital ratio would be the lower of each ratio of the two
approaches.
The proposal would not change the minimum risk-based capital ratios under the capital
rule. Also, the capital conservation buffer would continue to apply to risk-based capital ratios as
under the capital rule, except that the stress capital buffer requirement a component of the
capital conservation buffer that is applicable to banking organizations subject to the Board's
capital plan rule would apply to a banking organization's risk-based capital ratios regardless of
whether the ratios result from the expanded risk-based approach or the standardized approach.
Question 5: What are the advantages and disadvantages of banking organizations being
required to calculate risk-based capital ratios in two different ways and what alternatives, such
as a single calculation, should the agencies consider and why? What modifications, if any, to the
proposed structure of the risk-based capital calculation should the agencies consider?
1. Standardized output floor
To enhance the consistency of capital requirements and ensure that the use of internal
models for market risk does not result in unwarranted reductions in capital requirements, the
proposal would introduce an "output floor" to the calculation of expanded total risk-weighted
assets. This output floor would correspond to 72.5 percent of the sum of a banking organization's
credit risk-weighted assets, equity risk-weighted assets, operational risk-weighted assets, and
CVA risk-weighted assets under the expanded risk-based approach and risk-weighted assets
Page 24 of 1089
calculated using the standardized measure for market risk, minus any amount of the banking
organization's adjusted allowance for credit losses that is not included in tier 2 capital and any
amount of allocated transfer risk reserves.

The output floor would serve as a lower bound on the risk-weighted assets under the
expanded risk-based approach. In other words, if the risk-weighted assets under the expanded
risk-based approach were less than the output floor, the output floor would have to be used as the
risk-weighted asset amount to determine the expanded risk-based approach capital ratios.
The proposed calibration of the output floor aims to strike a balance between allowing
internal models to enhance the risk sensitivity of market risk capital requirements and ensuring
that these models would not result in unwarranted reductions in capital requirements. The output
floor would be consistent with the Basel III reforms, which would promote consistency in capital
requirements for large, complex, and internationally active banking organizations across
jurisdictions.
Question 6: What are the advantages and disadvantages of the proposed output floor?
2. Stress capital buffer requirement
Under the current capital rule, each banking organization is subject to one or more buffer
requirements, and must maintain capital ratios above the sum of its minimum requirements and
Page 25 of 1089
buffer requirements to avoid restrictions on capital distributions and certain discretionary bonus
payments.22 Banking organizations that are subject to the Board's capital plan rule²³ (bank
holding companies, U.S. intermediate holding companies, and savings and loan holding
companies that have over $100 billion or more in total consolidated assets) are currently subject
to a standardized approach capital conservation buffer requirement, which is calculated as the
sum of the banking organization's stress capital buffer requirement, applicable countercyclical
capital buffer requirement, and applicable GSIB surcharge. The standardized approach capital
conservation buffer requirement applies to a banking organization's standardized approach risk-
based capital ratios. In addition, banking organizations that are subject to the capital plan rule
and the advanced approaches requirements are subject to an advanced approaches capital
conservation buffer requirement, which applies to their advanced approaches risk-based capital
ratios, and which is calculated in the same manner as the standardized approach capital
conservation buffer requirement, except that the banking organization's stress capital buffer
requirement is replaced with a 2.5 percent buffer requirement.²
The stress capital buffer requirement integrates the results of the Board's supervisory
stress tests with the risk-based requirements of the capital rule to determine capital distribution
limitations. As a result, required capital levels for each banking organization more closely align
with the banking organization's risk profile and projected losses as measured by the Board's
stress test. The stress capital buffer requirement is generally calculated as (1) the difference

banking organizations); 12 CFR 238.170 (savings and loan holding companies).

between the banking organization's starting and minimum projected common equity tier 1
capital ratios under the severely adverse scenario in the supervisory stress test (stress test losses)
plus (2) the sum of the dollar amount of the banking organization's planned common stock
dividends for each of the fourth through seventh quarters of the planning horizon as a percentage
of risk-weighted assets (dividend add-on).²6 A banking organization's stress capital buffer
requirement cannot be less than 2.5 percent of standardized total risk-weighted assets.
26
Currently, the stress test losses and dividend add-on portion of the stress capital buffer
requirement are calculated using only the standardized approach common equity tier 1 capital
ratio. This is consistent with the exclusion of the stress capital buffer requirement from the
advanced approaches capital conservation buffer requirement, and with the Board's stress testing
and capital plan rules, under which banking organizations are not required to project capital
ratios using the advanced approaches.
The Board is proposing to amend its capital plan rule, stress testing rule, and the buffer
framework in its capital rule to take into account capital ratios calculated under the expanded
risk-based approach, in addition to the standardized approach. Under the proposal, banking
organizations subject to the capital plan rule would be subject to a single capital conservation
buffer requirement, which would include the stress capital buffer requirement, applicable
countercyclical capital buffer requirement, and applicable GSIB surcharge, and would apply to
the banking organization's risk-based capital ratios, regardless of whether the ratios result from
the expanded risk-based approach or the standardized approach. In this manner, the proposal
would ensure that the stress capital buffer requirement contributes to the robustness and risk-
sensitivity of the risk-based capital requirements of these banking organizations. Application of
26 12 CFR 225.8(f)(2); 12 CFR 238.170(f)(2).
Page 27 of 1089
the stress capital buffer requirement to the risk-based capital ratios derived from the expanded
risk-based approach would not introduce complexity given the fixed balance sheet assumption
currently used in the Board stress tests and because the expanded risk-based approach is based in
mostly standardized requirements.27
Additionally, the proposal would revise the calculation of the stress capital buffer
requirement for large banking organizations. Under the proposal, both the stress test losses and
dividend add-on components of the stress capital buffer requirement would be calculated using
the binding common equity tier 1 capital ratio, as of the final quarter of the previous capital plan
cycle, regardless of whether it results from the expanded risk-based approach or the standardized
approach.28 The proposed calculation methodology would limit complexity relative to potential
alternatives, such as introducing two stress capital buffer requirements for each banking
organization (one for each approach to calculating total risk-weighted assets). In addition, the
proposed approach recognizes that the binding approach for a banking organization is unlikely to
change within the period in which a given stress capital buffer requirement is applicable.
As part of the capital buffer framework, the stress capital buffer requirement helps ensure
that a banking organization can withstand losses from a severely adverse scenario, while still
meeting its minimum regulatory capital requirements and thereby continuing to serve as a viable
27
Initially, the Board did not incorporate the stress capital buffer requirement into the advanced
approaches capital conservation buffer requirement owing to the complexity involved in doing
SO.
28 The Board's Stress Testing Policy Statement includes an assumption that the magnitude of a
banking organization's balance sheet will be fixed throughout the projection horizon under the
supervisory stress test. 12 CFR part 252, Appendix B. Under this assumption, because the
denominators of the common equity tier 1 capital ratios as calculated under the standardized
approach and the expanded risk-based approach would remain the same throughout the stress
test, the approach under which the binding common equity tier 1 capital ratio is calculated would
remain the same throughout the final quarter of the previous capital plan cycle and the projection
horizon.
Page 28 of 1089
financial intermediary. Because this proposal aims to better reflect the risk of banking
organizations' exposures in the calculation of risk-weighted assets, without changing the targeted
level of conservatism of the minimum capital requirements, the Board is not proposing
associated changes to the targeted severity of the stress capital buffer requirement. The Board
evaluates the minimum risk-based capital requirements, which are largely determined by risk-
weighted assets, and the stress capital buffer requirement individually for their specific intended
purposes in the capital framework, and holistically as they determine the aggregate capital
banking organizations hold in the normal course of business.
In addition to revising the stress capital buffer requirement, the proposal would amend
the Board's stress testing and capital plan rules to require banking organizations subject to
Category I, II, or III standards to project their risk-based capital ratios in their company-run
stress tests and capital plans using the calculation approach that results in the binding ratios as of
the start of the projection horizon (generally, as of December 31 of a given year). Also, the
proposal would require banking organizations subject to Category IV standards to project their
risk-based capital ratios under baseline conditions in their capital plans and FR Y-14A
submissions using the risk-weighted assets calculation approach that results in the binding ratios
as of the start of the projection horizon. The use of the binding approach to calculating risk-based
capital ratios aims to conform company-run stress tests and capital plans with the binding risk-
based capital ratios in the proposed capital rule and promote simplicity relative to possible
alternatives (such as requiring that firms project ratios under both the expanded risk-based
approach and the standardized approach).
Question 7: The Board invites comment on the appropriate level of risk capture for the
risk-weighted assets framework and the stress capital buffer requirement, both for their
Page 29 of 1089
respective roles in the capital framework and for their joint determination of overall capital
requirements. How should the Board balance considerations of overall capital requirements with
the distinct roles of minimum requirements and buffer requirements? What adjustments, if any,
to either piece of the framework should the Board consider? Which, if any, specific portfolios or
exposure classes merit particular attention and why?
Question 8: What are the advantages and disadvantages of applying the same stress
capital buffer requirement to a banking organization's risk-based capital ratios regardless of
whether they are determined using the standardized or expanded risk-based approach? What
would be the advantages and disadvantages of applying different stress capital buffer
requirements for each set of risk-based capital ratios?
Question 9: What, if any, adjustments should the Board consider with respect to the
buffer requirements to account for the transitions in this proposal, particularly related to
expanded total risk-weighted assets? For example, what would be the advantages and
disadvantages of the Board determining stress capital buffer requirements using fully phased-in
expanded total risk-weighted assets versus transitional expanded total risk-weighted assets?
What, if any, additional adjustments to stress capital buffer requirements should the Board
consider during the expanded total risk-weighted assets transition?
B. Definition of capital
The agencies regularly review their capital framework to help ensure it is functioning as
intended. Consistent with this ongoing assessment, the agencies believe it is appropriate to align
the definition of capital for banking organizations subject to Category III or IV capital standards
with the definition currently applicable to banking organizations subject to Category I or II
capital standards. The current definition of capital applicable to banking organizations subject to
Page 30 of 1089
Category I or II capital standards provides for risk sensitivity and transparency that is
commensurate with the size, complexity, and risk profile of banking organizations subject to
Category III or IV capital standards. The proposed alignment of the numerator and denominator
of regulatory capital ratios of large banking organizations would support the transparency of the
capital rule as it facilitates market participants' assessment of loss absorbency and would
promote consistency of requirements across large banking organizations.
As described in more detail below, under the proposal, banking organizations subject to
Category III or IV capital standards would be required to recognize most elements of AOCI in
regulatory capital consistent with the treatment for banking organizations subject to Category I
or II capital standards. Banking organizations subject to Category III or IV capital standards
would also apply the capital deductions and minority interest treatments that are currently
applicable to banking organizations subject to Category I or II capital standards. The proposal
would also apply total loss absorbing capacity (TLAC) holdings deduction treatments to banking
organizations subject to Category III or IV capital standards. The proposal includes a three-year
transition period for AOCI.
1. Accumulated other comprehensive income
Under the current capital rule, banking organizations subject to Category I or II capital
standards are required to include most elements of AOCI in regulatory capital; whereas all other
banking organizations including those subject to Category III or IV capital standards were
provided an opportunity to make a one-time election to opt-out of recognizing most elements of
AOCI and related deferred tax assets (DTAs) and deferred tax liabilities within regulatory capital
Page 31 of 1089
(AOCI opt-out banking organizations).²9 Under the proposal, consistent with the treatment
applicable to banking organizations subject to Category I or II capital standards, banking
organizations subject to Category III or IV capital standards would be required to include all
AOCI components in common equity tier 1 capital, except gains and losses on cash-flow hedges
where the hedged item is not recognized on a banking organization's balance sheet at fair value.
This would require all net unrealized holding gains and losses on available-for-sale (AFS) debt
securities30 from changes in fair value to flow through to common equity tier 1 capital, including
those that result primarily from fluctuations in benchmark interest rates. This treatment would
better reflect the point in time loss-absorbing capacity of banking organizations subject to
Category III or IV capital standards and would align with banking organizations subject to
Category I or II capital standards.
The agencies have previously observed that the requirement to recognize elements of
AOCI in regulatory capital has helped improve the transparency of regulatory capital ratios, as it
better reflects banking organizations' actual loss-absorbing capacity at a specific point in time,
29
See 12 CFR 3.22(b) (OCC); 12 CFR 217.22(b) (Board); 12 CFR 324.22(b) (FDIC). A banking
organization that made an opt-out election is currently required to adjust common equity tier 1
capital as follows: subtract any net unrealized holding gains and add any net unrealized holding
losses on available-for-sale securities; subtract any accumulated net gains and add any
accumulated net losses on cash flow hedges; subtract any amounts recorded in AOCI attributed
to defined benefit postretirement plans resulting from the initial and subsequent application of
the relevant GAAP standards that pertain to such plans (excluding, at the banking organization's
option, the portion relating to pension assets deducted under section 22(a)(5) of the current
capital rule); and, subtract any net unrealized holding gains and add any net unrealized holding
losses on held-to-maturity securities that are included in AOCI.
30 AFS securities refers to debt securities. ASC Subtopic 321-10 eliminated the classification of
equity securities with readily determinable fair values not held for trading as available-for-sale
and generally requires investments in equity securities to be measured at fair value with changes
in fair value recognized in net income. Changes in the fair value of (i.e., the unrealized gains and
losses on) a banking organization's equity securities are recognized through net income rather
than other comprehensive income.
Page 32 of 1089
notwithstanding the potential volatility that such recognition may pose for their regulatory capital
ratios. The agencies have also previously observed that AOCI is an important indicator used by
market participants to evaluate the capital strength of a banking organization.³¹ More recently,
the agencies have observed generally higher levels of securities classified as held-to-maturity
(HTM) among banking organizations that recognize AOCI in regulatory capital.³2
34
Changes in interest rates have led to net unrealized losses for banking organizations'
investment portfolios and brought into focus the importance of regulatory capital measures
reflecting the loss absorbing capacity of a banking organization. The agencies have observed that
adverse trends in a banking organization's GAAP equity can have negative market perception
and liquidity implications.33 Specifically, net unrealized losses on AFS securities included in
AOCI have reduced banking organizations' tangible book value and liquidity buffers,³4 which
can adversely affect market participants' assessments of capital adequacy and liquidity. Banking
organizations are often reluctant to sell these AFS securities as the unrealized losses would
become realized losses upon sale, thus reducing regulatory capital. However, banking
organizations may need to take such steps in order to meet liquidity needs. Recognizing elements
of AOCI in regulatory capital thus achieves a better alignment of regulatory capital with market
participants' assessment of loss-absorbing capacity.

consistent with the HTM classification, and situations that call into question or taint a banking
organization's intent to hold securities in the HTM category.

Question 10: What complementary measures should the banking agencies consider
regarding the regulatory capital treatment for securities held as HTM rather than AFS?
2. Regulatory capital deductions
The agencies have long limited the amount of intangible and higher-risk assets, such as
mortgage servicing assets (MSAs) and certain temporary difference DTAs, included in
regulatory capital and required deduction of the amounts above the limits. This is due to the
relatively high level of uncertainty regarding the ability of banking organizations to both
accurately value and realize value from these assets, especially under adverse financial
conditions. The current capital rule also limits the amount of investments in the capital
instruments of other banking organizations that can be reflected in regulatory capital.
Furthermore, the current capital rule limits the inclusion of minority interest³5 in regulatory
capital in recognition that minority interest is generally not available to absorb losses at the
banking organization's consolidated level and to prevent highly capitalized subsidiaries from
overstating the amount of capital available to absorb losses at the consolidated organization.
Under the current capital rule, banking organizations subject to Category I or II capital
standards must deduct from common equity tier 1 capital amounts of MSAs, temporary
difference DTAs that the banking organization could not realize through net operating loss
carrybacks, and significant investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions in
the form of common stock³6 (collectively, threshold items) that individually exceed 10 percent of
35
Minority interest, also referred to as non-controlling interest, reflects investments in the
capital instruments of subsidiaries of banking organizations that are held by third parties.
36
A significant investment in the capital of an unconsolidated financial institution is defined as
an investment in the capital of an unconsolidated financial institution where a banking
organization subject to Category I or II capital standards owns more than 10 percent of the issued
Page 34 of 1089
the banking organization's common equity tier 1 capital minus certain deductions and
adjustments. ³7 Banking organizations subject to Category I or II capital standards must also
deduct from common equity tier 1 capital the aggregate amount of threshold items not deducted
under the 10 percent threshold deduction but that nevertheless exceeds 15 percent of the banking
organization's common equity tier 1 capital minus certain deductions and adjustments. Under the
current capital rule, banking organizations subject to Category III or IV capital standards are
required to deduct from common equity tier 1 capital any amount of MSAs, temporary difference
DTAs that the banking organization could not realize through net operating loss carrybacks, and
investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions³8 that individually exceed 25
percent of common equity tier 1 capital of the banking organization minus certain deductions and
adjustments.
Under the proposal, banking organizations subject to Category III or IV capital standards
would be required to deduct threshold items from common equity tier 1 capital and apply other
capital deductions that are currently applicable to banking organizations subject to Category I or
II capital standards instead of the deductions applicable to all other banking organizations,
thereby creating alignment across all banking organizations subject to the proposal.
and outstanding common stock of the unconsolidated financial institution. 12 CFR 3.2 (OCC);
12 CFR 217.2 (Board); 12 CFR 324.2 (FDIC).
37 See 12 CFR 3.22(c)(6), (d)(2) (OCC); 12 CFR 217.22(c)(6), (d)(2) (Board); 12 CFR
324.22(c)(6), (d)(2) (FDIC).
38 For banking organizations that are not subject to Category I or II capital standards, the current
capital rule does not have distinct treatments for significant and nonsignificant investments in the
capital of unconsolidated financial institutions. Rather, the regulatory capital treatment for an
investment in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions would be based on the type of
instrument underlying the investment.
Page 35 of 1089
In addition to deductions for the threshold items, the current capital rule requires that a
banking organization subject to Category I or II capital standards deduct from regulatory capital
any amount of the banking organization's nonsignificant investments³⁹ in the capital of
unconsolidated financial institutions that exceeds 10 percent of the banking organization's
common equity tier 1 capital minus certain deductions and adjustments.40 Further, significant
investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions not in the form of common
stock must be deducted from regulatory capital in their entirety.4¹ Under the proposal, banking
organizations subject to Category III or IV capital standards would be required to make these
deductions.
42
Similar to the deductions for investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial
institutions, the current capital rule requires banking organizations subject to Category I or II
capital standards to deduct covered debt instruments from regulatory capital.4² Under the
proposal, banking organizations subject to Category III or IV capital standards would be required
to apply the deduction requirements for certain investments in unsecured debt instruments issued
by U.S. or foreign GSIBs (covered debt instruments) that currently apply to banking
organizations subject to Category I or II capital standards.4³ The current capital rule generally
43
39
A non-significant investment in the capital of an unconsolidated financial institution is defined
as an investment in the capital of an unconsolidated financial institution where a banking
organization subject to Category I or II capital standards owns 10 percent or less of the issued
and outstanding common stock of the unconsolidated financial institution. 12 CFR 3.2 (OCC);
12 CFR 217.2 (Board); 12 CFR 324.2 (FDIC).

excluded covered debt and the applicable capital treatment, would not apply to banking
Page 36 of 1089
treats investments in unsecured debt instruments issued by U.S. or foreign GSIBs as tier 2 capital
instruments for purposes of applying deduction requirements.
The current capital rule also limits the amount of minority interest that banking
organizations subject to Category I or II capital standards may include in regulatory capital based
on the amount of capital held by a consolidated subsidiary, relative to the amount of capital the
subsidiary would have had to maintain to avoid any restrictions on capital distributions and
discretionary bonus payments under capital conservation buffer requirements.44 Under the
current capital rule, banking organizations subject to Category III or IV capital standards are
allowed to include: (i) common equity tier 1 minority interest comprising up to 10 percent of the
parent banking organization's common equity tier 1 capital; (ii) tier 1 minority interest
comprising up to 10 percent of the parent banking organization's tier 1 capital; and (iii) total
capital minority interest comprising up to 10 percent of the parent banking organization's total
capital.45 Under the proposal, the limitations on minority interests that apply to banking
organizations subject to Category I or II capital standards would also apply to banking
organizations subject to Category III or IV capital standards.
3. Additional definition of capital adjustments
The current capital rule applies an additional capital eligibility criterion to banking
organizations subject to Category I or II capital standards for their additional tier 1 and tier 2
capital instruments. The criterion requires that the governing agreement, offering circular or
prospectus for the instrument must disclose that the holders of the instrument may be fully
organizations subject to Category III and IV capital standards. See 12 CFR 3.2 (OCC); 12 CFR
217.2) (Board); 12 CFR 324.2 (FDIC).

Page 37 of 1089
subordinated to interests held by the U.S. government in the event the banking organization
enters into a receivership, insolvency, liquidation, or similar proceeding. Under the proposal, this
eligibility criterion would also apply to instruments issued after the date on which the issuer
becomes subject to the proposed rule, which generally would be the effective date of a final rule
for banking organizations subject to Category III or IV capital standards. Instruments issued by
banking organizations subject to Category III or IV capital standards prior to the effective date of
a final rule that currently count as regulatory capital would continue to count as regulatory
capital as long as those instruments remain outstanding.
4. Changes to the definition of tier 2 capital applicable to large banking
organizations
The current capital rule defines an element of tier 2 capital to include the allowance for
loan and lease losses (ALLL) or the adjusted allowance for credit losses (AACL), as applicable,
up to 1.25 percent of standardized total risk-weighted assets not including any amount of the
ALLL or AACL, as applicable (and excluding in the case of a banking organization subject to
market risk requirements, its standardized market risk-weighted assets). Further, as part of its
calculations for determining its total capital ratio, a banking organization subject to Category I or
II standards must determine its advanced-approaches-adjusted total capital by (1) deducting from
its total capital any ALLL or AACL, as applicable, included in its tier 2 capital and; (2) adding to
its total capital any eligible credit reserves that exceed the banking organization's total expected
credit losses to the extent that the excess reserve amount does not exceed 0.6 percent of credit-
risk-weighted assets. Due to changes in GAAP, all large banking organizations are no longer
using ALLL and must use AACL. In addition, the concept of eligible credit reserves is related to
use of the internal ratings-based approach, which the proposal would eliminate. Therefore, under
Page 38 of 1089
the proposal, a large banking organization would determine its expanded risk-based approach-
adjusted total capital by (1) deducting from its total capital AACL included in its tier 2 capital
and; (2) adding to its total capital any AACL up to 1.25 percent of total credit risk-weighted
assets. The proposal would define total credit risk-weighted assets as the sum of total risk-
weighted assets for: (1) general credit risk as calculated under §__.110; (2) cleared transactions
and default fund contributions as calculated under §____.114; (3) unsettled transactions as
calculated under §___.115; and (4) securitization exposures as calculated under §___.132.
Question 11: The agencies seek comment on the proposed definition of total credit risk-
weighted assets in connection with determining a banking organization's total capital ratio.
What, if any, modifications should the agencies consider making to this definition and why?
C. Credit risk
Credit risk arises from the possibility that an obligor, including a borrower or
counterparty, will fail to perform on an obligation. While loans are a significant source of credit
risk, other products, activities, and services also expose banking organizations to credit risk,
including investments in debt securities and other credit instruments, credit derivatives, and cash
management services. Off-balance sheet activities, such as letters of credit, unfunded loan
commitments, and the undrawn portion of lines of credit, also expose banking organizations to
credit risk.
In this section of the Supplementary Information, subsection III.C.1. describes
expectations for completing due diligence on a banking organization's credit risk portfolio;
subsection III.C.2. describes the risk-weight treatment for on-balance sheet exposures under the
proposal; subsection III.C.3. describes the proposed approach to determine the exposure amount
for off-balance sheet exposures; and subsections III.C.4.-5 provide the available approaches for
Page 39 of 1089
recognizing the benefits of credit risk mitigants including certain guarantees, certain credit
derivatives and financial collateral.
1. Due diligence
Banking organizations must maintain capital commensurate with the level and nature of
the risks to which they are exposed.46 The agencies' safety and soundness guidelines establish
standards for banking organizations to have an adequate understanding of the impact of their
lending decisions on the banking organization's credit risk.47 A banking organization's
performance of due diligence on their credit portfolios is central to meeting both of these
obligations. For example, under the safety and soundness guidelines, a banking organization is
expected to have established effective internal policies, processes, systems, and controls to
ensure that the banking organization's regulatory reporting is accurate and reflects appropriate
risk weights assigned to credit exposures.
When properly performed, due diligence may lead a banking organization to conclude
that the minimum regulatory capital requirements for certain exposures do not sufficiently
account for their potential credit risk. In such instances, the banking organization should take
appropriate risk mitigating measures such as allocating additional capital, establishing larger
credit loss allowances, or requiring additional collateral. Adherence to due diligence standards,
as established through the agencies' safety and soundness guidelines, directly supports and

managerial standards for loan documentation and credit underwriting as set forth in the
Interagency Guidelines Establishing Standards for Safety and Soundness (safety and soundness
guidelines).
Page 40 of 1089
facilitates requirements for banking organizations to maintain capital commensurate with the
level and nature of the risks to which they are exposed.
Question 12: The agencies seek comment on whether due diligence requirements should
be directly integrated into the text of the final rule. What would be the advantages and
disadvantages of specifying increases in risk weights that would be required to the extent that
due diligence requirements are not met, similar to the proposed risk-weight treatment for
securitization exposures as described in section III.D of this Supplementary Information?
2. Proposed risk weights for credit risk
The proposal would replace the use of internal models to set regulatory capital
requirements for credit risk as set out in subpart E of the current capital rule with a new
expanded risk-based approach for credit risk applicable to large banking organizations. The
proposed expanded risk-based approach for credit risk would retain many of the same definitions
§__.2 of the current capital rule including among others a sovereign, a sovereign exposure,
certain supranational entities, a multilateral development bank, a public sector entity (PSE), a
government-sponsored enterprise (GSE), other assets, and a commitment. Some elements of the
proposed expanded risk-based approach for credit risk would apply the same risk-weight
treatment provided in subpart D of the current capital rule (current standardized approach) for
on-balance sheet exposures, including exposures to sovereigns, certain supranational entities and
multilateral development banks, government sponsored entities (GSEs) in the form of senior debt
and guaranteed exposures, Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) and Federal Agricultural Mortgage
Corporation (Farmer Mac) equity exposures,49 public sector entities (PSEs), and other assets.
49
For treatment of other exposures to GSEs, see discussion related to equity exposures in section
III.E. and exposures to subordinated debt instruments in section III.C.2.d. of this Supplementary
Information.
Page 41 of 1089
The proposal would also apply the same risk-weight treatment provided in the current
standardized approach to the following real estate exposures: pre-sold construction loans,
statutory multifamily mortgages, and high-volatility commercial real estate (HVCRE) exposures.
Relative to the internal models-based approaches in the advanced approaches under the
current capital rule, the proposed expanded risk-based approach would result in more transparent
capital requirements for credit risk exposures across banking organizations. The proposal would
also facilitate comparisons of capital adequacy across banking organizations by reducing
excessive, unwarranted variability in risk-weighted assets for similar exposures. Relative to the
current standardized approach, the proposal would incorporate more granular risk factors to
allow for a broader range of risk weights.
Specifically, the proposal would introduce the expanded risk-based approach for
exposures to depository institutions, foreign banks, and credit unions; exposures to subordinated
debt instruments, including those to GSEs; and real estate, retail, and corporate exposures. The
proposal would also increase risk capture for certain off-balance sheet exposures through a new
exposure methodology for commitments without pre-set limits and would modify the credit
conversion factors applicable to commitments. Additionally, the proposal would introduce new
definitions for defaulted exposures and defaulted real estate exposures.
Under the proposal, a banking organization would determine the risk-weighted asset
amount for an on-balance sheet exposure by multiplying the exposure amount by the applicable
risk weight, consistent with the method used under the current standardized approach. The on-
balance sheet exposure amount would generally be the banking organization's carrying value50
50
Carrying value under §____. 2 of the current capital rule means, with respect to an asset, the
value of the asset on the balance sheet of the banking organization as determined in accordance
Page 42 of 1089
of the exposure, consistent with the value of the asset on the balance sheet as determined in
accordance with GAAP, which is the same as under the current capital rule. For all assets other
than AFS securities and purchased credit-deteriorated assets, the carrying value is not reduced by
any associated credit loss allowance that is determined in accordance with GAAP. Using the
value of an asset under GAAP to determine a banking organization's exposure amount would
reduce burden and provide a consistent framework that can be easily applied across all banking
organizations of the proposal because, in most cases, GAAP serve as the basis for the
information presented in financial statements and regulatory reports.
The proposal would group credit risk exposures into the following categories: sovereign
exposures; exposures to certain supranational entities and multilateral development banks;
exposures to GSEs; exposures to depository institutions, foreign banks, and credit unions;
exposures to PSEs; real estate exposures; retail exposures; corporate exposures; defaulted
exposures; exposures to subordinated debt instruments; and off-balance sheet exposures.
The proposed categories with amended risk-weight treatments relative to the current
standardized approach include equity exposures to GSEs and exposures to subordinated debt
instruments issued by GSEs; exposures to depository institutions, foreign banks, and credit
unions; exposures to subordinated debt instruments; real estate exposures; retail exposures;
corporate exposures; defaulted exposures; and some off-balance sheet exposures such as
51
with GAAP. For all assets other than available-for-sale debt securities or purchased credit
deteriorated assets, the carrying value is not reduced by any associated credit loss allowance that
is determined in accordance with GAAP. See 12 CFR 3.2 (OCC); 12 CFR 217.2 (Board); 12
CFR 324.2 (FDIC). The exposure amount arising from an OTC derivative contract; a repo-style
transaction or an eligible margin loan; a cleared transaction; a default fund contribution; or a
securitization exposure would be calculated in accordance with §§___. 113, 121, or 131 of the
proposal, respectively, as described in sections III.C.4, II.C.5.b., and III.D. of this Supplementary
Information.
51
See 12 U.S.C. § 1831n.
Page 43 of 1089
commitments. The proposed risk weight treatments for each of these categories are described in
the following sections of this Supplementary Information.
a. Defaulted exposures
The proposal would introduce an enhanced definition of a defaulted exposure that would
be broader than the current capital rule's definition of a defaulted exposure under subpart E. The
proposed scope and criteria of the defaulted exposure category is intended to appropriately
capture the elevated credit risk of exposures where the banking organization's reasonable
expectation of repayment has been reduced, including exposures where the obligor is in default
on an unrelated obligation. Under the proposal, a defaulted exposure would be any exposure that
is a credit obligation and that meets the proposed criteria related to reduced expectation of
repayment, and that is not an exposure to a sovereign entity,5² a real estate exposure,³³ or a policy
loan.54 The proposal would define a credit obligation as any exposure where the lender but not
the obligor is exposed to credit risk. In other words, for these exposures, the lender would have a
claim on the obligor that does not give rise to counterparty credit risk55 and would exclude
52
53
52 Under the proposal, the expanded risk-based approach would rely on the treatment of
sovereign default in the current standardized approach in the capital rule. See 12 CFR 3.32(a)(6)
(OCC); 12 CFR 217.32(a)(6) (Board); 12 CFR 324.32 (a)(6) (FDIC).
53 For the treatment of defaulted real estate exposures, see section III.C.2.e.vii of this
Supplementary Information.
54 A policy loan is defined under §___.2 of the current capital rule to mean means a loan by an
insurance company to a policy holder pursuant to the provisions of an insurance contract that is
secured by the cash surrender value or collateral assignment of the related policy or contract. A
policy loan includes: (1) A cash loan, including a loan resulting from early payment benefits or
accelerated payment benefits, on an insurance contract when the terms of contract specify that
the payment is a policy loan secured by the policy; and (2) An automatic premium loan, which is
a loan that is made in accordance with policy provisions which provide that delinquent premium
payments are automatically paid from the cash value at the end of the established grace period
for premium payments. See 12 CFR 3.2 (OCC); 12 CFR 217.2 (Board); 12 CFR 324.2 (FDIC).
55 Counterparty credit risk is the risk that the counterparty to a transaction could default before
the final settlement of the transaction where there is a bilateral risk of loss.
Page 44 of 1089
derivative contracts, cleared transactions, default fund contributions, repo-style transactions,
eligible margin loans, equity exposures, and securitization exposures.
For all other exposure categories (excluding an exposure to a sovereign entity, real estate
exposure, a retail exposure, or a policy loan), the proposed definition of defaulted exposure
would look to the performance of the borrower with respect to credit obligations to any creditor.
Specifically, if the banking organization determines that an obligor meets any of the of the
defaulted criteria for exposures that are not retail exposures, described further below, the
proposal would require the banking organization to treat all exposures that are credit obligations
of that obligor as defaulted exposures. Additionally, the proposal would differentiate the criteria
for determining whether an exposure is a defaulted exposure between exposures that are retail
exposures and those that are not.
Retail exposures are originated to individuals or small- and medium-sized businesses.
Evaluating whether a retail borrower has other exposures that are in default as defined by the
proposal may be difficult to operationalize for banking organizations given many unique
obligors. For other types of exposures that are not retail exposures, evaluating default at the
obligor level is appropriate because those obligors are more likely to have additional credit
obligations that are large and held by multiple banking organizations. Default on one of those
credit obligations would be indicative of increased riskiness of the exposure held by a banking
organization, and hence a banking organization should account for this in evaluating the risk
profile of the borrower.
Under the proposal, for a retail exposure, a credit obligation would be considered a
defaulted exposure if any of the following has occurred: (1) the exposure is 90 days past due or
in nonaccrual status; (2) the banking organization has taken a partial charge-off, write-down of
Page 45 of 1089
principal, or negative fair value adjustment on the exposure for credit-related reasons, until the
banking organization has reasonable assurance of repayment and performance for all contractual
principal and interest payments on the exposure; or (3) a distressed restructuring of the exposure
was agreed to by the banking organization, until the banking organization has reasonable
assurance of repayment and performance for all contractual principal and interest payments on
the exposure as demonstrated by a sustained period of repayment performance, provided that a
distressed restructuring includes the following made for credit-related reasons: forgiveness or
postponement of principal, interest, or fees, term extension, or an interest rate reduction. A
sustained period of repayment performance by the borrower is generally a minimum of six
months in accordance with the contractual terms of the restructured exposure.
For exposures that are not retail exposures (excluding an exposure to a sovereign entity, a
real estate exposure, or a policy loan), a credit obligation would be considered a defaulted
exposure if either of the following has occurred: (1) the obligor has a credit obligation to the
banking organization that is 90 days or more past due56 or in nonaccrual status; or (2) the
banking organization determines that, based on ongoing credit monitoring, the obligor is unlikely
to pay its credit obligations to the banking organization in full, without recourse by the banking
organization. If a banking organization determines that an obligor meets these proposed criteria,
the proposal would require the banking organization to treat all exposures that are credit
obligations of that obligor as defaulted exposures.
For purposes of the second criterion, the proposal would require a banking organization
to consider an obligor as unlikely to pay its credit obligations if any of the following criteria
56 Overdrafts are past due and are considered defaulted exposures once the obligor has breached
an advised limit or been advised of a limit smaller than the current outstanding balance.
Page 46 of 1089
apply: (1) the obligor has any credit obligation that is 90 days or more past due or in nonaccrual
status with any creditor; (2) any credit obligation of the obligor has been sold at a credit-related
loss; (3) a distressed restructuring of any credit obligation of the obligor was agreed to by any
creditor, provided that a distressed restructuring includes the following made for credit-related
reasons: forgiveness or postponement of principal, interest, or fees, term extension or an interest
rate reduction; (4) the obligor is subject to a pending or active bankruptcy proceeding; or (5) any
creditor has taken a full or partial charge-off, write-down of principal, or negative fair value
adjustment on a credit obligation of the obligor for credit-related reasons. Under the proposal,
banking organizations are expected to conduct ongoing credit monitoring regarding relevant
obligors. The proposal would require banking organizations to continue to treat an exposure as a
defaulted exposure until the exposure no longer meets the definition or until the banking
organization determines that the obligor meets the definition of investment grade57 or the
proposed definition of speculative grade.58 The proposal would revise the definition of
speculative grade, consistent with the current definition of investment grade, to allow the
definition to apply to entities to which the banking organization is exposed through a loan or
security. In addition, the proposal would make the same revision to the definition of sub-
speculative grade.
57 Under §___.2 of the current capital rule, investment grade means that the entity to which the
banking organization is exposed through a loan or security, or the reference entity with respect to
a credit derivative, has adequate capacity to meet financial commitments for the projected life of
the asset or exposure. Such an entity or reference entity has adequate capacity to meet financial
commitments if the risk of its default is low and the full and timely repayment of principal and
interest is expected. See 12 CFR 3.2 (OCC); 12 CFR 217.2 (Board); 12 CFR 324.2 (FDIC).
58 The proposal would revise the definition of speculative grade to mean that the entity to which
a banking organization is exposed through a loan or security, or the reference entity with respect
to a credit derivative, has adequate capacity to meet financial commitments in the near term, but
is vulnerable to adverse economic conditions, such that should economic conditions deteriorate,
the issuer or the reference entity would present an elevated default risk.
Page 47 of 1089
A banking organization would assign a 150 percent risk weight to a defaulted exposure
including any exposure amount remaining on the balance sheet following a charge-off, and any
other non-retail exposure to the same obligor, to reflect the increased uncertainty as to the
recovery of the remaining carrying value. The proposed risk weight is intended to reflect the
impaired credit quality of defaulted exposures and to help ensure that banking organizations
maintain sufficient regulatory capital for the increased probability of losses on these exposures.
A banking organization may apply a risk weight to the guaranteed or secured portion of a
defaulted exposure based on (1) the risk weight under section §___.120 of the proposal if the
guarantee or credit derivative meets the applicable requirements or (2) the risk weight under
section §.121 of the proposal if the collateral meets the applicable requirements.
Question 13: How does the defaulted exposure definition compare with banking
organizations' existing policies relating to the determination of the credit risk of a defaulted
exposure and the creditworthiness of a defaulted obligor? What additional clarifications are
necessary to determine the point at which retail and non-retail exposures should no longer be
treated as defaulted exposures?
Question 14: What operational challenges, if any, would a banking organization face in
identifying which exposures meet the proposed definition of defaulted exposure? In particular,
the agencies seek comment on the ability of a banking organization to obtain the necessary
information to assess whether the credit obligations of a borrower to creditors other than the
banking organization would meet the proposed criteria? What operational challenges, if any,
would a banking organization face in identifying whether obligors on non-retail credit
obligations are subject to a pending or active bankruptcy proceeding?
Page 48 of 1089
Question 15: For the purposes of retail credit obligations, the agencies invite comment
on the appropriateness of including a borrower's bankruptcy as a criterion for a defaulted
exposure. What operational challenges, if any, would a banking organization face in identifying
whether obligors on retail credit obligations are subject to a pending or active bankruptcy
proceeding? To what extent would criteria (1) through (3) in the proposed defaulted exposure
definition for retail exposures sufficiently capture the risk of a borrower involved in a
bankruptcy proceeding?
Question 16: What alternatives to the proposed treatment should the agencies consider
while maintaining a risk-sensitive treatment for credit risk of a defaulted borrower? For
example, what would be the advantages and disadvantages of limiting the defaulted borrower
scope to obligations of the borrower with the banking organization?
b. Exposures to government-sponsored enterprises
The proposal would assign a 20 percent risk weight to GSE59 exposures that are not
equity exposures, securitization exposures or exposures to a subordinated debt instrument issued
by a GSE, consistent with the current standardized approach.60 Under the proposal, an exposure
to the common stock issued by a GSE would be an equity exposure. An exposure to the preferred
stock issued by a GSE would be an equity exposure or an exposure to a subordinated debt
59 Government-sponsored enterprise (GSE) under §__. 2 of the current capital rule means an
entity established or chartered by the U.S. government to serve public purposes specified by the
U.S. Congress but whose debt obligations are not explicitly guaranteed by the full faith and
credit of the U.S. government. See 12 CFR 3.2 (OCC); 12 CFR 217.2 (Board); 12 CFR 324.2
(FDIC).
60 Similar to the treatment of senior debt exposures to GSEs and GSE exposures that are not
equity exposures or exposures to a subordinated debt instrument issued by a GSE, the proposal
would apply the same 20 percent risk weight to all exposures to FHLB or Farmer Mac, including
equity exposures and exposures to subordinated debt instruments, which continues the treatment
under the current standardized approach.
Page 49 of 1089
instrument, depending on the contractual terms of the preferred stock instrument. Equity
exposures to a GSE must be assigned a risk-weighted asset amount as calculated under sections
____.140 through ____.142 of subpart E. An exposure to a subordinated debt instrument issued by a
GSE must be assigned a 150 percent risk weight, unless issued by a FHLB or Farmer Mac. As
discussed later in sections III.E. and III.C.2.d. of this Supplementary Information, equity
exposures and exposures to subordinated debt instruments would generally be subject to an
increased risk-based capital requirement to reflect their heightened risk relative to exposures to
senior debt.
c. Exposures to depository institutions, foreign banks, and credit unions
The proposal would define the scope of exposures to depository institutions, foreign
banks, and credit unions in a manner that is consistent with the definitions and scope of
exposures covered under the current capital rule. Under the proposal, a bank exposure would
mean an exposure (such as a receivable, guarantee, letter of credit, loan, OTC derivative
contract, or senior debt instrument) to any depository institution, foreign bank, or credit union.61
The proposed treatment for bank exposures supports the simplicity, transparency, and
consistency objectives of the proposal in a manner that is appropriately risk sensitive. The
proposal would provide three categories for bank exposures that are ranked from the highest to
the lowest in terms of creditworthiness: Grade A, Grade B, and Grade C. The assignment of the
61
Under §__.2 of the current capital rule, a depository institution means a depository institution
as defined in section 3 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, a foreign bank means a foreign
bank as defined in section 211.2 of the Federal Reserve Board's Regulation K (12 CFR 211.2)
(other than a depository institution), and a credit union means an insured credit union as defined
under the Federal Credit Union Act (12 U.S.C. § 1751 et seq.). See 12 CFR 3.2 (OCC); 12 CFR
217.2 (Board); 12 CFR 324.2 (FDIC). Exposures to other financial institutions, such as bank
holding companies, savings and loans holding companies, and securities firms, generally would
be considered corporate exposures. See 78 FR 62087 (October 11, 2013).
Page 50 of 1089
bank exposure category would be based on the obligor depository institution, foreign bank, or
credit union. As outlined below, the proposal would rely on the current capital rule's definition
of investment grade and the proposed definition of speculative grade for differentiating the credit
risk of bank exposures. In addition, the proposal would incorporate publicly disclosed capital
levels to differentiate the financial strength of a depository institution, foreign bank, or credit
union in a manner that is both objective and transparent to supervisors and the public.
More specifically, a Grade A bank exposure would mean a bank exposure for which the
obligor depository institution, foreign bank, or credit union (1) is investment grade, and (2)
whose most recent publicly disclosed capital ratios meet or exceed the higher of: (a) the
minimum capital requirements and any additional amounts necessary to not be subject to
limitations on distributions and discretionary bonus payments under the capital rules established
by the prudential supervisor of the depository institution, foreign bank, or credit union, and (b) if
applicable, the capital ratio requirements for the well-capitalized category under the agencies'
prompt corrective action framework,62 or under similar rules of the National Credit Union
Administration. For example, an exposure to an investment grade depository institution could
qualify as a Grade A bank exposure if the depository institution was not subject to limitations on
distributions and discretionary bonus payments under the capital rules and had risk-based capital
ratios that met the well capitalized thresholds under the agencies' prompt corrective action
framework. Further, a bank exposure to a depository institution that had opted into the
community bank leverage ratio (CBLR) framework and is investment grade would be considered
63
62
The capital ratios used for this determination are the ratios on the depository institution's most
recent quarterly Consolidated Report of Condition and Income (Call Report).
63
See 12 CFR part 702 (National Credit Union Administration).
Page 51 of 1089
to be a Grade A bank exposure, even if the obligor depository institution were in the grace period
under the CBLR framework.64 Under the proposal, a depository institution that uses the CBLR
framework would not be required to calculate or disclose risk-based capital ratios for purposes of
qualifying as a Grade A bank exposure.
A Grade B bank exposure would mean a bank exposure that is not a Grade A bank
exposure and for which the obligor depository institution, foreign bank, or credit union (1) is
speculative grade or investment grade, and (2) whose most recent publicly disclosed capital
ratios meet or exceed the higher of: (a) the applicable minimum capital requirements under
capital rules established by the prudential supervisor of the depository institution, foreign bank,
or credit union, and (b) if applicable, the capital ratio requirements for the adequately-capitalized
category65 under the agencies' prompt corrective action framework,66 or under similar rules of
the National Credit Union Administration."
For a foreign bank to qualify as a Grade A or Grade B bank exposure, the proposal would
require the applicable capital standards imposed by the home country supervisor to be consistent
with international capital standards issued by the Basel Committee.
A Grade C bank exposure would mean a bank exposure that does not qualify as a Grade
A or Grade B bank exposure. For example, a bank exposure would be a Grade C bank exposure
if the obligor depository institution, foreign bank, or credit union has not publicly disclosed its
capital ratios within the last six months. In addition, an exposure would be a Grade C bank
64
See 12 CFR 3.12(a)(1) (OCC); 12 CFR 217.12(a)(1) (Board); 12 CFR 324.12(a)(1) (FDIC).
65 See 12 CFR 6.4(b)(2) (OCC); 12 CFR 208.43(b)(2) (Board); 12 CFR 324.403(b)(2) (FDIC).
66 The capital ratios used for this determination are the ratios on the depository institution's most
recent quarterly Call Report.
67 See 12 CFR part 702 (National Credit Union Administration).
Page 52 of 1089
exposure if the external auditor of the depository institution, foreign bank, or credit union has
issued an adverse audit opinion or has expressed substantial doubt about the ability of the
depository institution, foreign bank, or credit union to continue as a going concern within the
previous 12 months.
Under the proposal, a foreign bank exposure that is a Grade A or Grade B bank exposure
and is a self-liquidating, trade-related contingent item that arises from the movement of goods
and that has a maturity of three months or less may be assigned a risk weight that is lower than
the risk weight applicable to other exposures to the same foreign bank. The proposed approach to
providing a preferential risk weight for short-term self-liquidating, trade-related contingent items
would be consistent with the current standardized approach.
The proposal would also address the risk that capital and foreign exchange controls
imposed by a sovereign entity in which a foreign bank is located could prevent or materially
impede the ability of the foreign bank to convert its currency to meet its obligations or transfer
funds. The proposal would, therefore, provide a risk weight floor for foreign bank exposures
based on the risk weight applicable to a sovereign exposure for the jurisdiction where the foreign
bank is incorporated when (1) the exposure is not in the local currency of the jurisdiction where
the foreign bank is incorporated; or (2) the exposure to a foreign bank branch that is not in the
local currency of the jurisdiction in which the foreign branch operates (sovereign risk-weight
floor).68 The risk weight floor would not apply to short-term self-liquidating, trade-related
contingent items that arise from the movement of goods.
68
See §.111 for the proposed sovereign risk-weight table, which is identical to Table 1 to
§.32 in the current capital rule.
Page 53 of 1089
As provided in Table 2, the proposed risk weights for bank exposures generally would
range from 40 percent to 150 percent.

Question 17: What are the advantages and disadvantages of assigning a range of risk
weights based on the bank's creditworthiness? What alternatives, if any, should the agencies
consider, including to address potential concerns around procyclicality?
Question 18: What are the advantages and disadvantages of incorporating specific
capital levels in the determination of each of the three categories of bank exposures? What, if
any, other risk factors should the banking agencies consider to differentiate the credit risk of
bank exposures? What concerns, if any, could limitations on available information about foreign
banks raise in the context of determining the appropriate risk weights for exposures to such
banks and how should the agencies consider addressing such concerns?
Question 19: What is the impact of limiting the lower risk weight for self-liquidating,
trade-related contingent items that arise from the movement of goods to those with a maturity of
three months or less? What would be the advantages and disadvantages of expanding this risk
weight treatment to include such exposures with a maturity of six months or less? What would be
Page 54 of 1089
the advantages and disadvantages of limiting this reduced risk weight treatment to only foreign
banks whose home country has an Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development
(OECD) Country Risk Classification (CRC)69 of 0, 1, 2, or 3, or is an OECD member with no
CRC, consistent with the current standardized approach?70
d. Subordinated debt instruments
The proposal would introduce a definition and an explicit risk weight treatment for
exposures in the form of subordinated debt instruments. The proposed definition of a
subordinated debt instrument would capture exposures that are financial instruments and present
heightened credit risk but are not equity exposures, including: (1) any preferred stock that does
not meet the definition of an equity exposure, (2) any covered debt instrument, including a
TLAC debt instrument, that is not deducted from regulatory capital, and (3) any debt instrument
that qualifies as tier 2 capital under the current capital rule or that would otherwise be treated as
regulatory capital by the primary federal supervisor of the issuer and that is not deducted from
regulatory capital.
The proposal would define a subordinated debt instrument as (1) a debt security that is a
corporate exposure, a bank exposure, or an exposure to a GSE, including a note, bond,
69 Under §___. 2 of the current capital rule, a Country Risk Classification (CRC) for a sovereign
means the most recent consensus CRC published by the Organization for Economic Cooperation
and Development (OECD) as of December 31st of the prior calendar year that provides a view of
the likelihood that the sovereign will service its external debt. See 12 CFR 3.2 (OCC); 12 CFR
217.2 (Board); 12 CFR 324.2 (FDIC). For more information on the OECD country risk
classification methodology, see OECD, "Country Risk Classification,” available at
https://www.oecd.org/trade/topics/export-credits/arrangement-and-sector-
understandings/financing-terms-and-conditions/country-risk-classification/.
70 The CRCs reflect an assessment of country risk, used to set interest rate charges for
transactions covered by the OECD arrangement on export credits. The CRC methodology
classifies countries into one of eight risk categories (0–7), with countries assigned to the zero
category having the lowest possible risk assessment and countries assigned to the 7 category
having the highest possible risk assessment. See 78 FR 62088.
Page 55 of 1089
debenture, similar instrument, or other debt instrument as determined by the primary federal
supervisor, that is subordinated by its terms, or separate intercreditor agreement, to any creditor
of the obligor, or (2) preferred stock that is not an equity exposure. For these purposes, a debt
security would be subordinated if the documentation creating or evidencing such indebtedness
(or a separate intercreditor agreement) provides for any of the issuer's other creditors to rank
senior to the payment of such indebtedness in the event the issuer becomes the subject of a
bankruptcy or other insolvency proceeding, with the scope of applicable bankruptcy or other
insolvency proceedings being defined in the applicable documentation. The scope of the
definition of a subordinated debt instrument is meant to capture the types of entities that issue
subordinated debt instruments and for which the level of subordination is a meaningful
determinant of the credit risk of the instrument.
In addition, even though the provision of collateral typically reduces the risk of loss on
indebtedness, the proposal includes secured as well as unsecured subordinated debt securities in
the scope of subordinated debt instruments, since the effect of subordination may result in the
collateral providing little or no real value to the subordinated debt holder in the event the issuer
becomes to subject of a bankruptcy or other insolvency proceeding. A subordinated debt
instrument would not include any loan, including a syndicated loan, a debt security issued by a
sovereign, public sector entity, multilateral development bank, or supranational entity, or a
security that would be captured under the securitization framework. Due to the contractual
obligations and structures associated with subordinated debt instruments, such exposures
generally pose increased risk relative to a senior loan, including a syndicated loan, or a senior
debt security to the same entity because investments in subordinated debt instruments are usually
Page 56 of 1089
considered junior creditors and subordinate to obligations specified in the definition of senior
debt in the document governing the junior creditors' obligations.
The proposal generally would apply a 150 percent risk weight for exposures that meet the
definition of a subordinated debt instrument, including any preferred stock that is not an equity
exposure, and any tier 2 instrument or covered debt instrument that is not deducted from
regulatory capital, including TLAC debt instruments, and any debt instrument that would
otherwise be treated as regulatory capital by the primary federal supervisor of the issuer and that
is not deducted from regulatory capital.71
The instruments included in the scope of subordinated debt instruments present a greater
risk of loss to an investing banking organization relative to more senior debt exposures to the
same issuer because subordinated debt instruments have a lower priority of repayment in the
event of default. As a result, the proposal would apply an increased risk weight to recognize this
increase in loss given default. Since a covered debt instrument that qualifies as a TLAC debt
instrument shares similar risk characteristics with a subordinated debt instrument, the proposal
would require banking organizations to apply the same 150 percent risk weight to any such
exposures that are not otherwise deducted from regulatory capital.
Question 20: The agencies seek comment on the scope of the proposed definition of a
subordinated debt instrument. What, if any, operational challenges might the proposed definition
71 Covered debt instruments are subject to deduction by banking organizations subject to
Category I or II capital standards similar to the deduction framework for exposures to capital
instruments. See 12 CFR 3.22(c) (OCC); 12 CFR 217.22(c) (Board); 12 CFR 324.22(c) (FDIC).
As noted in section III.B.3. of this Supplementary Information, under the proposal, this
deduction framework will be expanded to banking organizations subject to Category III or IV
capital standards. As discussed in section III.C.2.b. above, exposures to subordinated debt
instruments issued by an FHLB or by Farmer Mac would be assigned a 20 percent risk weight.
Page 57 of 1089
pose for banking organizations, such as identifying the level of subordination in debt securities
or similar instruments, and how should the agencies consider addressing such challenges?
Question 21: Would expanding the definition of a subordinated debt instrument to
include loans that are not securities more appropriately capture the types of exposures that pose
elevated risk and, if so, why?
Question 22: The agencies seek comment on applying a heightened 150 percent risk
weight to exposures to subordinated debt instruments issued by GSES. What would be the
advantages and disadvantages of this proposed regulatory capital requirement? Would there be
any challenges for banking organizations to be able to identify which GSE exposures would be
subject to the 150 percent risk weight? Please provide specific examples of any challenges and
supporting data.
e. Real estate exposures
The proposal would define a real estate exposure as an exposure that is neither a
sovereign exposure nor an exposure to a PSE and that is (1) a residential mortgage exposure, (2)
secured by collateral in the form of real estate,7² (3) a pre-sold construction loan,7³ (4) a statutory
72 For purposes of the proposal, "secured by collateral in the form of real estate” should be
interpreted in a manner that is consistent with the current definition for "a loan secured by real
estate" in the Call Report and Consolidated Financial Statements for Holding Companies (FR Y-
9C) instructions.
7³ The Resolution Trust Corporation Refinancing, Restructuring, and Improvement Act of 1991
(RTCRRI Act) mandates that each agency provide in its capital regulations (i) a 50 percent risk
weight for certain one-to-four-family residential pre-sold construction loans that meet specific
statutory criteria in the RTCRRI Act and any other underwriting criteria imposed by the
agencies, and (ii) a 100 percent risk weight for one-to-four-family residential pre-sold
construction loans for residences for which the purchase contract is cancelled. See 12 U.S.C. §
1831n, note.
Page 58 of 1089
multifamily mortgage,74 (5) a high volatility commercial real estate (HVCRE) exposure,75 or (6)
an acquisition, development, or construction (ADC) exposure. A pre-sold construction loan, a
statutory multifamily mortgage, and an HVCRE exposure are collectively referred to as statutory
real estate exposures for purposes of this Supplementary Information. Under the proposal, the
risk weight treatment for statutory real estate exposures that are not defaulted real estate
exposures would be consistent with the current standardized approach.
The proposal would differentiate the credit risk of real estate exposures that are not
statutory real estate exposures by introducing the following categories: regulatory residential real
estate exposures, regulatory commercial real estate exposures, ADC exposures, and other real
estate exposures. The applicable risk weight for these non-statutory real estate exposures would
depend on (1) whether the real estate exposure meets the definitions of regulatory residential real
estate exposure, regulatory commercial real estate exposure, ADC exposure, or other real estate
exposure, described below; (2) whether the repayment of such exposures is dependent on the
cash flows generated by the underlying real estate (such as rental properties, leased properties,
hotels); and (3) in the case of regulatory residential or regulatory commercial real estate
exposures, the loan-to-value (LTV) ratio of the exposure.
These proposed criteria for differentiating the credit risk of real estate exposures would
be based on information already collected and maintained by a banking organization as part of its
74
The RTCRRI Act mandates that each agency provide in its capital regulations a 50 percent risk
weight for certain multifamily residential loans that meet specific statutory criteria in the
RTCRRI Act and any other underwriting criteria imposed by the agencies. See 12 U.S.C. §
1831n, note.
75 Section 214 of the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act
imposes certain requirements on high volatility commercial real estate acquisition, development,
or construction loans. Section 214 of Pub. L. No. 115-174, 132 Stat. 1296 (2018). See 12 U.S.C.

mortgage lending activities and underwriting practices. Under the proposal, regulatory residential
and regulatory commercial real estate exposures would be required to meet prudential criteria
that are intended to reduce the likelihood of default relative to other real estate exposures. The
criteria in these definitions generally align with existing Interagency Guidelines for Real Estate
Lending Policies (real estate lending guidelines).76 Real estate loans in which repayment is
dependent on the cash flows generated by the real estate can expose a banking organization to
elevated credit risk relative to comparable exposures77 as the borrower may be unable to meet its
financial commitments when cash flows from the property decrease, such as when tenants
default or properties are unexpectedly vacant. In addition, LTV ratios can be a useful risk
indicator because the amount of a borrower's equity in a real estate property correlates inversely
with default risk and provides banking organizations with a degree of protection against losses.7⁹
Therefore, exposures with lower LTV ratios generally would receive a lower risk weight than
comparable real estate exposures with higher LTV ratios under the proposal.80 The following
chart illustrates how the proposal would require a banking organization to assign risk weights to
various real estate exposures, as described in more detail below:

depends on non-real estate cash flows such as owner-occupied properties, revenue from
manufacturing or retail sales.

Under the proposal, a regulatory residential real estate exposure would be defined as a
first-lien residential mortgage exposure (as defined in §____.2) that is not a defaulted real estate
exposure (as defined in §____. 101), an ADC exposure, a pre-sold construction loan, a statutory
multifamily mortgage, or an HVCRE exposure, provided the exposure meets certain prudential
criteria.³¹ First, the loan would be required to be secured by a property that is either owner-
occupied or rented. Second, the exposure would be required to be made in accordance with
prudent underwriting standards, including standards relating to the loan amount as a percent of
the value of the property.82 Third, during the underwriting process, the banking organization
would be required to apply underwriting policies that account for the ability of the borrower to
repay based on clear and measurable underwriting standards that enable the banking organization
to evaluate these credit factors. The agencies would expect these underwriting standards to be
consistent with the agencies' safety and soundness and real estate lending guidelines.83 Fourth,
the property must be valued in accordance with the proposed requirements included in the
proposed LTV ratio calculation, as discussed below.
ii. Regulatory commercial real estate exposures
The proposal would define a regulatory commercial real estate exposure as a real estate
exposure that is not a regulatory residential real estate exposure, a defaulted real estate exposure,
81 Consistent with the standardized approach in the capital rule, under the proposal, when a
banking organization holds the first-lien and junior-lien(s) residential mortgage exposures and no
other party holds an intervening lien, the banking organization must combine the exposures and
treat them as a single first-lien regulatory residential real estate exposure, if the first-lien meets
all of the criteria for a regulatory residential real estate exposure.

Information.

an ADC exposure, a pre-sold construction loan, a statutory multifamily mortgage, or an HVCRE
exposure, provided the exposure meets several prudential criteria. First, the exposure must be
primarily secured by fully completed real estate. Second, the banking organization must hold a
first priority security interest in the property that is legally enforceable in all relevant
jurisdictions.84 Third, the exposure must be made in accordance with prudent underwriting
standards, including standards relating to the loan amount as a percent of the value of the
property. Fourth, during the underwriting process, the banking organization must apply
underwriting policies that account for the ability of the borrower to repay in a timely manner
based on clear and measurable underwriting standards that enable the banking organization to
evaluate these credit factors. The agencies would expect that these underwriting standards would
be consistent with the agencies' safety and soundness and real estate lending guidelines. Finally,
the property must be valued in accordance with the proposed requirements included in the
proposed LTV ratio calculation, as discussed below.
Question 23: The agencies seek comment on the application of prudent underwriting
standards in the proposed definitions of regulatory residential and regulatory commercial real
estate exposures, including standards relating to the loan amount as a percent of the value of the
property. What, if any, further clarity is needed and why?
111. Exposures that are dependent on the cash flows generated by the real estate
As noted above, the proposal would differentiate the risk weight of regulatory residential,
regulatory commercial, and other real estate exposures based on whether the borrower's ability
84 When the banking organization also holds a junior security interest in the same property and
no other party holds an intervening security interest, the banking organization must treat the
exposures as a single first-lien regulatory commercial real estate exposure, if the first-lien meets
all of the criteria for a regulatory commercial real estate exposure.
Page 63 of 1089
to service the loan is dependent on cash flows generated by the real estate. Exposures that are
dependent on the cash flows generated by real estate to repay the loan can be affected by local
market conditions and present elevated credit risk relative to exposures that are serviceable by
the income, cash, or other assets of the borrower. For example, an increase in the supply of
competitive rental property can lower demand and suppress cash flows needed to support
repayment of the loan.
If the underwriting process at origination of the real estate exposure considers any cash
flows generated by the real estate securing the loan, such as from lease or rental payments or
from the sale of the real estate as a source of repayment, then the exposure would meet the
proposal's definition of dependent on the cash flows generated by the real estate. Evaluating
whether repayment of the exposure is dependent on cash flows generated from the real estate is a
conservative and straightforward approach for differentiating the credit risk of real estate
exposures. Given their increased credit risk, the proposal would assign relatively higher risk
weights to exposures that are dependent on any proceeds or income generated from the real
estate itself to service the debt.
Under the proposal, additional loan characteristics can affect whether an exposure would
be considered dependent on cash flows from the real estate. The proposal's definition of
dependence on the cash flows generated by the real estate would exclude any residential
mortgage exposure that is secured by the borrower's principal residence as such mortgage
exposures present reduced credit risk relative to real estate exposures that are secured by the
borrower's non-principal residence.85 For residential properties that are not the borrower's
85
For example, if (1) a borrower purchases a two-unit property with the intention of making one
unit their principal residence, (2) the borrower intends to rent out the second unit to a third party,
Page 64 of 1089
principal residence, including vacation homes and other second homes, such properties would be
considered dependent on the cash flows generated by the real estate unless the banking
organization has relied solely on the borrower's personal income and resources, rather than rental
income (or resale or refinance of the property), to repay the loan.
For regulatory commercial real estate exposures, the applicable risk weights similarly
would be determined based on whether repayment is dependent on the cash flows generated by
the real estate. For example, the agencies would expect that rental office buildings, hotels, and
shopping centers leased to tenants are dependent on the cash flows generated by the real estate
for repayment of the loan. In the case of a loan to a borrower to purchase or refinance real estate
where the borrower will operate a business such as a retail store or factory and rely solely on the
revenues from the business or resources of the borrower other than rental, resale, or other income
from the real estate for repayment, the exposure would not be considered dependent on the cash
flows generated by the real estate under the proposal. Similarly, a loan to the owner-operator of a
farm would not be considered dependent on the cash flows generated by the real estate under the
proposal if the borrower will rely solely on the sale of products from the farm or other resources
of the borrower other than rental, resale, or other income from the real estate for repayment.
Question 24: What, if any, alternative quantitative threshold should the agencies
consider in determining whether a real estate exposure is dependent on cash flows from the real
estate (for example, a threshold between 5 and 50 percent of the income)? Further, if the
agencies decide to adopt an alternative quantitative threshold, either for regulatory residential
and (3) the banking organization considered the cash flows from the rental unit as a source of
repayment, the exposure would not meet the proposal's definition of dependent on the cash flows
generated by the real estate because the property securing the exposure is the borrower's
principal residence.
Page 65 of 1089
or regulatory commercial real estate exposures, how should it be calibrated for regulatory
residential and separately for regulatory commercial real estate exposures and what would be
the appropriate calibration levels for each? Please provide specific examples of any alternatives,
including calculations and supporting data.
Question 25: The agencies seek feedback on the proposed treatment of exposures secured
by second homes, including vacation homes where repayment of the loan is not dependent on
cash flows. What are the advantages and disadvantages of treating such exposures as regulatory
residential real estate exposures? Would a different category be more appropriate for these
exposures given their risk profile, and if so, describe which other category(s) of real estate
exposures would be most similar and why. Please provide supporting data in your responses.86
Question 26: The agencies seek comment on the treatment of residential mortgage
exposures where repayment is dependent on cash flows from overnight or short-term rentals, as
such cash flows may not be as reliable as a source of repayment as cash flows from long-term
rental contracts or the borrower's other income sources. What would be the advantages or
disadvantages of treating residential real estate exposures dependent on cash flows from short-
term rentals similar to commercial real estate exposures dependent on cash flows?
Calculating the loan-to-value ratio
The proposal would require a banking organization also to use LTV ratios to assign a risk
weight to a regulatory residential or regulatory commercial real estate exposure. Under the
proposal, LTV ratio would be calculated as the extension of credit divided by the value of the
iv.
86 See Garcia, Daniel (2019). "Second Home Buyers and the Housing Boom and Bust,” Finance
and Economics Discussion Series 2019-029. Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal
Reserve System, https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/feds/files/2019029pap.pdf.
Page 66 of 1089
property. The proposed calculation of LTV ratio would be generally consistent with the real
estate lending guidelines except with respect to the recognition of private mortgage insurance, as
described below.
The extension of credit would mean the total outstanding amount of the loan including
any undrawn committed amount of the loan. The total outstanding amount of the loan would
reflect the current amortized balance as the loan pays down, which may allow a banking
organization to assign a lower risk weight during the life of the loan. Similarly, if a loan balance
increases, a banking organization would need to increase the risk weight if the increased LTV
would result in a higher risk weight. For purposes of the LTV ratio calculation, a banking
organization would calculate the loan amount without making any adjustments for credit loss
provisions or private mortgage insurance. Not recognizing private mortgage insurance would be
consistent with the current capital rule's definition of eligible guarantor, which does not
recognize an insurance company engaged predominately in the business of providing credit
protection (such as a monoline bond insurer or re-insurer) and also reflects the performance of
private mortgage insurance during times of stress in the housing market. The agencies do not
intend the proposed risk weights to be applied to LTVs that include private mortgage insurance.
The value of the property would mean the value at the time of origination of all real
estate properties securing or being improved by the extension of credit, plus the fair value of any
readily marketable collateral and other acceptable collateral, as defined in the real estate lending
guidelines, that secures the extension of credit.
For exposures subject to the Real Estate Lending, Appraisal Standards, and Minimum
Requirements for Appraisal Management Companies or Appraisal Standards for Federally
Page 67 of 1089
Related Transactions (combined, the appraisal rule),87 the market value of real estate would be a
valuation that meets all requirements of that rule. For exposures not subject to the appraisal rule,
the proposal would require that (1) the market value of real estate be obtained from an
independent valuation of the property using prudently conservative valuation criteria and (2) the
valuation be done independently from the banking organization's origination and underwriting
process. Most real estate exposures held by insured depository institutions are subject to the
agencies' appraisal rule, which also provides for evaluations in some cases, and provides for
certain exceptions, such as where a lien on real estate is taken as an abundance of caution. To
help ensure that the value of the real estate is determined in a prudently conservative manner, the
proposal would also provide that, for exposures not subject to the appraisal rule, the valuations of
the real estate properties would need to exclude expectations of price increases and be adjusted
downward to take into account the potential for the current market prices to be significantly
above the values that would be sustainable over the life of the loan.
In addition, when the real estate exposure finances the purchase of the property, the value
would be the lower of (1) the actual acquisition cost of the property and (2) the market value
obtained from either (i) the valuation requirements under the appraisal rule (if applicable) or (ii)
as described above, an independent valuation using prudently conservative valuation criteria that
is separate from the banking organization's origination and underwriting process. Supervisory
experience has shown that market values of real estate properties can be temporarily impacted by
local market forces and using a value figure including such volatility would not reflect the long-
87

part 225, subpart G (Board); 12 CFR part 323 (FDIC).
Page 68 of 1089
term value of the real estate. Therefore, the proposal would require that the value used for the
LTV calculation be an amount that is more conservative than the market value of the property.
Using the value of the property at origination when calculating the LTV ratio protects
against volatility risk or short-term market price inflation. For purposes of the LTV ratio
calculation, the proposal would require banking organizations to use the value of the property at
the time of origination, except under the following circumstances: (1) the banking organization's
primary federal supervisor requires the banking organization to revise the property value
downward; (2) an extraordinary event occurs resulting in a permanent reduction of the property
value (for example, a natural disaster); or (3) modifications are made to the property that increase
its market value and are supported by an appraisal or independent evaluation using prudently
conservative criteria. These proposed exceptions are intended to constrain the use of values other
than the value of the property at loan origination only to exceptional circumstances that are
sufficiently material to warrant use of a revised valuation.
For purposes of determining the value of the property, the proposal would use the
definition of readily marketable collateral and other acceptable collateral consistent with the real
estate lending guidelines. Therefore, readily marketable collateral would mean insured deposits,
financial instruments, and bullion in which the banking organization has a perfected security
interest. Financial instruments and bullion would need to be salable under ordinary
circumstances with reasonable promptness at a fair market value determined by quotations based
on actual transactions, on an auction or similarly available daily bid and ask price market.
Readily marketable collateral should be appropriately discounted by the banking organization
consistent with the banking organization's usual practices for making loans secured by such
collateral. Other acceptable collateral would mean any collateral in which the banking
Page 69 of 1089
organization has a perfected security interest that has a quantifiable value and is accepted by the
banking organization in accordance with safe and sound lending practices. Other acceptable
collateral should be appropriately discounted by the banking organization consistent with the
banking organization's usual practices for making loans secured by such collateral. Under the
proposal, other acceptable collateral would include, among other items, unconditional
irrevocable standby letters of credit for the benefit of the banking organization. The
reasonableness of a banking organization's underwriting criteria would be reviewed through the
examination and supervisory process to help ensure its real estate lending policies are consistent
with safe and sound banking practices.
Question 27: What are the benefits and drawbacks of allowing readily marketable
collateral and other acceptable collateral to be included in the value for purposes of calculating
the LTV ratio? What are the advantages and disadvantages of providing specific discount factors
to the value of acceptable collateral for purposes of calculating the LTV ratio such as the
standard supervisory market price volatility haircuts contained in section 121 of the proposed
rule? What alternatives should the agencies consider? Please provide specific examples and
supporting data.
Risk weights for regulatory residential real estate exposures
Under the proposal, a banking organization would assign a risk weight to a regulatory
residential real estate exposure based on the exposure's LTV ratio and whether the exposure is
dependent on the cash flows generated by the real estate, as reflected in Tables 5 and 6 below.
LTV ratios and dependence on cash flows generated by the real estate would factor into the risk-
weight treatment for real estate exposures under the proposal because these risk factors can be
determinants of credit risk for real estate exposures. The proposed corresponding risk weights in
V.

each LTV ratio category are intended to appropriately reflect differences in the credit risk of
these exposures. The risk weights that would apply under the proposal are provided below.88

While LTV ratios and dependency upon cash flows of the real estate are useful risk
indicators, the agencies recognize that banking organizations consider a variety of factors when
underwriting a residential real estate exposure and assessing a borrower's ability to repay. For
example, a banking organization may consider a borrower's current and expected income, current
and expected cash flows, net worth, other relevant financial resources, current financial
obligations, employment status, credit history, or other relevant factors during the underwriting
process. The agencies are supportive of home ownership and do not intend the proposal to have
88
The risk weight assigned to loans does not impact the appropriate treatment of loans under the
agencies' other regulations and guidance, such as the supervisory LTV limits under the real estate
lending guidelines.
Page 71 of 1089
a disparate impact on home affordability or homeownership opportunities, including for low- and
moderate-income (LMI) home buyers or other historically underserved markets. The agencies
are particularly interested in whether the proposed framework for regulatory residential real
estate exposures should be modified in any way to avoid unintended impacts on the ability of
otherwise credit-worthy borrowers who make a smaller down payment to purchase a home. For
example, the agencies are considering whether a 50 percent risk weight would be appropriate for
these loans, to the extent they are originated in accordance with prudent underwriting standards
and originated through a home ownership program that the primary federal regulatory agency
determines provides a public benefit and includes risk mitigation features such as credit
counseling and consideration of repayment ability.
Question 28: The agencies seek comment on how the proposed treatment of regulatory
residential real estate exposures will impact home affordability and home ownership
opportunities, particularly for LMI borrowers or other historically underserved markets. What
are the advantages and disadvantages of an alternative treatment that would assign a 50 percent
risk weight to mortgage loans originated in accordance with prudent underwriting standards
and originated through a home ownership program that the primary federal regulatory agency
determines provides a public benefit and includes risk mitigation features such as credit
counseling and consideration of repayment ability? What, if any, additional or alternative risk
indicators should the agencies consider, besides loan-to-value or dependency upon cash flow for
risk-weighting regulatory residential real estate exposures? Please provide specific examples of
mortgage lending programs where such factors were the basis for underwriting the loans and the
historical repayment performance of the loans in such programs. Please comment on whether
Page 72 of 1089
these risk indicators are already collected and maintained by banking organizations as part of
their mortgage lending activities and underwriting practices.
In addition, the agencies considered adopting an alternative risk-based capital treatment
in subpart E that does not rely on loan-to-value ratios or dependency upon cash flow generated
by the real estate. One such alternative would be to incorporate the same treatment for
residential mortgage exposures as found in the current U.S. standardized risk-based capital
framework. Under this alternative, the risk-based capital treatment for residential mortgage
exposures in subpart D of the capital rule would be incorporated into the proposed subpart E.
First-lien residential mortgage exposures that are prudently underwritten would receive a 50
percent risk weight consistent with the treatment contained in the U.S. standardized risk-based
capital framework. Such an approach would allow banking organizations to continue to offer
prudently underwritten products through lending programs with the flexibility to meet the needs
of their communities without additional regulatory capital implications. The agencies note that
current mortgage rules promulgated since the global financial crisis require lenders to consider
each borrower's ability to repay. 89
As in subpart D, residential mortgage exposures that do not meet the requirements
necessary to receive a 50 percent risk weight would receive a 100 percent risk weight. While
such an approach would not use loan-to-value or dependency upon cash flow generated by the
real estate to assign a risk-weight, it would provide for a simpler framework where all prudently
underwritten first-lien residential mortgage exposures would receive the same risk-based capital
treatment. Lastly and consistent with the treatment in subpart D, if a banking organization holds
the first and junior lien(s) on a regulatory residential real estate exposure and no other party
89 See 12 CFR 1026.
Page 73 of 1089
holds an intervening lien, the banking organization would be required to treat the combined
exposure as a single loan secured by a first lien for purposes of assigning a risk weight.
Question 29: The agencies seek comment on assigning risk weights to residential
mortgage exposures, consistent with the current U.S. standardized risk-based capital framework.
What are the pros and cons of this alternative treatment?
vi. Risk weights for regulatory commercial real estate exposures
In a manner similar to regulatory residential real estate exposure, the proposal would
require a banking organization to assign a risk weight to a regulatory commercial real estate
exposure based on the exposure's LTV ratio and whether the exposure is dependent on the cash
flows generated by the real estate, as reflected in Tables 7 and 8 below. For regulatory
commercial real estate exposures that are not dependent on cash flows for repayment, the main
driver of risk to the banking organization is whether the commercial borrower would generate
sufficient revenue through its non-real estate business activities to repay the loan to the banking
organization. For this reason, under Table 7 the proposed risk weight for the exposure would be
dependent on the risk weight assigned to the borrower. For the purposes of Table 7, if the LTV
ratio of the exposures is greater than 60 percent, and the banking organization does not have
sufficient information about the exposure to determine what the risk weight applicable to the
borrower would be, the banking organization would be required to assign a 100 percent risk
weight to the exposure.

vii. Defaulted real estate exposures
The proposal would require banking organizations to apply an elevated risk weight to
defaulted real estate exposures, consistent with the approach to defaulted exposures described in
section III.C.2.a. of this Supplementary Information. The proposal would introduce a definition
of defaulted real estate exposure that would provide new criteria for determining whether a
residential mortgage exposure or a non-residential mortgage exposure is in default. These new
criteria are indicative of a credit-related default for such exposures. For residential mortgage
exposures, the definition of defaulted real estate exposure would require the banking
organization to evaluate default at the exposure level. For other real estate exposures that are not
residential mortgage exposures, the definition of defaulted real estate exposure would require the
banking organization to evaluate default at the obligor level, consistent with the approach
describe above for non-retail defaulted exposures.
Since residential mortgage exposures are primarily originated to individuals for the
purchase or refinancing of their primary residence, most obligors of residential real estate
exposures do not have additional real estate exposures. Therefore, determining default at the
exposure level would account for the material default risk of most residential mortgage
Page 75 of 1089
exposures. Additionally, evaluating defaulted residential mortgage exposures at the obligor level
may be difficult for banking organizations to operationalize, for example, if there are challenges
collecting information on the payment status of other obligations of individual borrowers.
In contrast, for other types of real estate exposures, such as regulatory commercial real
estate and ADC exposures, evaluating default at the obligor level would be more appropriate and
less challenging as those obligors frequently have other credit obligations that are large in value
and potentially held by multiple banking organizations. Default by an obligor on other credit
obligations, which a banking organization should account for when evaluating the risk profile of
the borrower, would indicate increased credit risk of the exposure held by a banking
organization.
A defaulted real estate exposure that is a residential mortgage exposure would include an
exposure (1) that is 90 days or more past due or in nonaccrual status; (2) where the banking
organization has taken a partial charge-off, write-down of principal, or negative fair value
adjustment on the exposure for credit-related reasons, until the banking organization has
reasonable assurance of repayment and performance for all contractual principal and interest
payments on the exposure; or (3) where the banking organization agreed to a distressed
restructuring that includes the following credit-related reasons: forgiveness or postponement of
principal, interest, or fees; term extension; or an interest rate reduction. Distressed restructuring
would not include a loan modified or restructured solely pursuant to the U.S. Treasury's Home
Affordable Mortgage Program.

The U.S. Treasury's Home Affordable Mortgage Program was created under the Troubled
Asset Relief Program in response to the subprime mortgage crisis of 2008. See Emergency
Economic Stabilization Act, Pub. L. 110-343, 122 Stat. 3765 (2008).
Page 76 of 1089
To determine if a non-residential mortgage exposure would be a defaulted real estate
exposure, banking organizations would apply the same criteria as described above in section
III.C.2.a. of this Supplementary Information that are used to determine if a non-retail exposure is
a defaulted exposure. Banking organizations are expected to conduct ongoing credit reviews of
relevant obligors. The proposal would require banking organizations to continue to treat non-
residential real estate exposures that meet this definition as defaulted real estate exposures until
the non-residential real estate exposure no longer meets the definition or until the banking
organization determines that the obligor meets the definition of investment grade or speculative
grade.
Under the proposal, a defaulted real estate exposure that is a residential mortgage
exposure not dependent on the cash flows generated by the real estate would receive a risk
weight of 100 percent, regardless of whether the exposure qualifies as a regulatory real estate
exposure, unless a portion of the real estate exposure is guaranteed under section §__.120 of the
proposal. This treatment is consistent with the risk weight for past due residential mortgage
exposures under the current standardized approach. Additionally, a residential mortgage
guaranteed by the federal government through the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) or the
Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) generally will be risk-weighted at 20 percent under the
proposal, including a residential mortgage guaranteed by FHA or VA that meets the defaulted
real estate exposure definition.
Any other defaulted real estate exposure would receive a risk weight of 150 percent,
including any other non-residential real estate exposure to the same obligor, consistent with the
proposed risk weight of other defaulted exposures described in section II.C.2.a. of this
Supplementary Information. A banking organization may apply a risk weight to the guaranteed
Page 77 of 1089
portion of defaulted real estate exposures based on the risk weight that applies under section
§.120 of the proposal if the guarantee or credit derivative meets the applicable requirements.
Question 31: How does the defaulted real estate exposure definition compare with
banking organizations' existing policies relating to the determination of the credit risk of
defaulted real estate exposures and the creditworthiness of defaulted real estate obligors? What,
if any, additional clarifications are necessary to determine the point at which residential and
non-residential mortgages should no longer be treated as defaulted exposures? Please provide
specific examples and supporting data.
Question 32: For purposes of commercial real estate exposures, the agencies invite
comment on the extent to which obligors have outstanding other exposures with multiple banking
organizations and other creditors. What would be the advantages and disadvantages of
considering both the obligor and the parent company or other entity or individual that owns or
controls the obligor when determining if the exposure meets the criteria for "defaulted real
estate exposure"?
Question 33: For purposes of residential mortgage exposures, the agencies invite
comment on the appropriateness of including a borrower's bankruptcy as a criterion for
defaulted real estate exposure. Would criteria (1)(i) through (1)(iii) in the proposed defaulted
real estate definition for residential mortgages sufficiently capture the risk of a borrower
involved in a bankruptcy proceeding?
viii. ADC exposures that are not HVCRE exposures
Under the proposal, the agencies would define an ADC exposure as an exposure secured
by real estate for the purpose of acquiring, developing, or constructing residential or commercial
real estate properties, as well as all land development loans, and all other land loans. Some ADC
Page 78 of 1089
exposures meet the definition of HVCRE exposure in §___.2 of the capital rule and would be
91
assigned a 150 percent risk weight.º¹ Real estate exposures that meet the definition of ADC
exposure but do not meet the criteria of an HVCRE exposure or a defaulted real estate exposure
would be assigned a 100 percent risk weight under the proposal. The proposed regulatory
treatment for ADC exposures would not take into consideration cash flow dependency or LTV
ratio criteria. ADC exposures are mostly short-term or bridge loans to cover construction or
development, or lease up or sales phases of a real estate project, rather than an amortizing
permanent loan for completed residential or commercial real estate. Supervisory experience has
shown that ADC exposures have heightened risk compared to permanent commercial real estate
exposures, and these exposures generally have been subject to a risk weight of 100 percent or
more under the current standardized approach. Repayment of ADC loans is often based on the
expected completion of the construction or development of the property, which can be delayed or
interrupted by many factors such as changes in market condition or financial difficulty of the
obligor.
ix. Other real estate exposures
The proposal would define other real estate exposures as real estate exposures that are not
defaulted real estate exposures, regulatory commercial real estate exposures, regulatory
residential real estate exposures, ADC exposures, or any of the statutory real estate exposures.
An exposure meeting the proposed definition of other real estate exposure poses
heightened credit risk as a result of not meeting the proposed prudential underwriting criteria
⁹1 Section 214 of the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act
(EGRRCPA) imposes certain requirements on high volatility commercial real estate acquisition,
development, or construction loans. Section 214 of Pub. L. No. 115-174, 132 Stat. 1296 (2018);
12 U.S.C. § 1831bb.
Page 79 of 1089
included in the definitions of regulatory residential and regulatory commercial real estate,
respectively, and accordingly would be assigned a higher risk weight. Specifically, the proposal
would require a banking organization to assign a 150 percent risk weight to an other real estate
exposure, unless the exposure is a residential mortgage exposure that is not dependent on the
cash flows generated by the real estate, which must be assigned a 100 percent risk weight.
For example, a banking organization would assign a 150 percent risk weight to real estate
exposures that are dependent on the cash flows generated by the underlying real estate, such as a
rental property, and that do not meet the regulatory residential or regulatory commercial real
estate exposure definitions. Loans for the purpose of acquiring real estate and reselling it at
higher value that do not qualify as ADC loans and do not meet the definition of regulatory
residential real estate exposures would be assigned a 150 percent risk weight as other real estate
exposures. The proposed 150 percent risk weight also would provide a regulatory capital
incentive for banking organizations to originate real estate exposures in accordance with the
prudential qualification requirements for regulatory residential and commercial real estate
exposures, respectively.
In other cases, if a banking organization does not adequately evaluate the
creditworthiness of a borrower for an owner-occupied residential mortgage exposure, or if the
borrower has inadequate creditworthiness or capacity to repay the loan, the exposure would not
be considered prudently underwritten and would be assigned a 100 percent risk weight instead of
the lower risk weights included in Table 5 for regulatory residential mortgage exposures not
dependent on the cash flows generated by the real estate. The 100 percent risk weight would also
apply to junior lien home equity lines of credit and other second mortgages given the elevated
risk of these loans when compared to similar senior lien loans.
Page 80 of 1089
f. Retail exposures
Relative to the current standardized approach, and as described in more detail below, the
proposal would increase the credit risk-sensitivity of the capital requirements applicable to retail
exposures by assigning risk weights that would vary depending on product type and the degree
of portfolio diversification. The proposal would introduce a new definition of retail exposure,
which would include an exposure to a natural person or persons, or an exposure to a small or
medium-sized entity (SME)⁹² that meets the proposed definition of a regulatory retail exposure
described below. Including an exposure to an SME in the definition of a retail exposure provides
a benefit for small companies, such as smaller limited liability companies, which may have
characteristics more similar to those of a natural person than of a larger corporation. The
proposed definition of a retail exposure would be narrower in scope than the current capital
rule's existing definition of a retail exposure under subpart E, which includes a broader range of
exposures, including real estate-related exposures. Because the proposal would include separate
risk-weight treatments for real estate exposures that account for the underlying collateral, the
proposed definition of a retail exposure would only apply to a retail exposure that would not
otherwise be a real estate exposure.⁹:
93
⁹2 An SME would mean an entity in which the reported annual revenues or sales for the
consolidated group of which the entity is a part are less than or equal $50 million for the most
recent fiscal year. This scope is generally consistent with the definition of an SME under the
Basel III reforms and also corresponds with the maximum receipts-based size standard for small
businesses set by the Small Business Administration, which varies by industry and does not
exceed $47 million per year. See 13 CFR part 121.
93 For an exposure that qualifies as a real estate exposure and also meets conditions (1) and (2) of
the definition of a retail exposure, the proposal would require a banking organization to treat the
exposure as a real estate exposure and calculate risk-based requirements for the exposure as
described in section III.C.2.e of this Supplementary Information.
Page 81 of 1089
The proposal would differentiate the risk-weight treatment for retail exposures based on
whether (1) the exposure qualifies as a regulatory retail exposure, (2) further qualifies as a
transactor exposure; or (3) does not qualify for either of the previous categories and is treated as
an other retail exposure. The proposed definitions of a regulatory retail exposure and a transactor
exposure outlined below include key criteria for broadly categorizing the relative credit risk of
retail exposures.
To qualify as a regulatory retail exposure, the proposal would require the exposure to be
in the form of any of the following credit products: a revolving credit or line of credit (such as a
credit card, charge card, or overdraft) or a term loan or lease (such as an installment loan, auto
loan or lease, or student or educational loan) (collectively, eligible products). In addition, under
the proposal, the amount of retail exposures that a banking organization could treat as regulatory
retail exposures would be limited on an aggregate and granular basis. A banking organization
would include all outstanding and committed but unfunded regulatory retail exposures
accounting for any applicable credit conversion factor when aggregating the retail exposures.
Specifically, the regulatory retail exposure category would exclude any retail exposure to a
single obligor and its affiliates that, in the aggregate with any other retail exposures to that
obligor or its affiliates, including both on- and off-balance sheet exposures, exceeds a combined
total of $1 million (aggregate limit).
In addition, for any single retail exposure, only the portion up to 0.2 percent of the
banking organization's total retail exposures that are eligible products (granularity limit) would
be considered a regulatory retail exposure. The portion of any single retail exposure that exceeds
the granularity limit would not qualify as a regulatory retail exposure. For purposes of
calculating the 0.2 percent granularity limit for a regulatory retail exposure, off-balance sheet
Page 82 of 1089
exposures would be subject to the applicable credit conversion factors, as discussed in
§___.112(b), and defaulted exposures, as discussed in §___.101(b) of the proposal, would be
excluded. Under the proposal, if an exposure to an SME does not meet criteria (1) through (3) of
the definition of a regulatory retail exposure, then none of the exposures to that SME would
qualify as retail exposures and all of the exposures to that SME would be treated as corporate
exposures.
The proposal would define a transactor exposure as a regulatory retail exposure that is a
credit facility where the balance has been repaid in full at each scheduled repayment date for the
previous twelve months or an overdraft facility where there has been no drawdown over the
previous twelve months. If a single obligor had both a credit facility and an overdraft facility
from the same banking organization, the banking organization would separately evaluate each
facility to determine whether each facility would meet the definition of a transactor exposure to
be categorized as a transactor exposure.
Under the proposal, a banking organization would assign a risk weight of 55 percent to a
regulatory retail exposure that is a transactor exposure and an 85 percent risk weight to a
regulatory retail exposure that is not a transactor exposure. All other retail exposures would be
assigned a 110 percent risk weight. The proposed 55 percent risk weight for a transactor
exposure is appropriate because obligors that demonstrate a historical repayment capacity
generally exhibit less credit risk relative to other retail obligors. A regulatory retail exposure that
is not a transactor exposure warrants the proposed 85 percent risk weight, which would be lower
than the proposed 110 percent risk weight for all other retail exposures, due to mitigating factors
related to size or concentration risk. The aggregate limit and granularity limit are intended to
ensure that the regulatory retail portfolio consists of a set of small exposures to a diversified
Page 83 of 1089
group of obligors, which would reduce credit risk to the banking organization. Conversely,
banking organizations with a high aggregate amount of retail exposures to a single obligor, or
exposures exceeding the granularity limit, have a heightened concentration of retail exposures.
This concentration of retail exposures increases the level of credit risk the banking organization
has to a single obligor, and the likelihood that the banking organization could face material
losses if the obligor misses a payment or defaults. Therefore, any retail exposure that would not
qualify as a regulatory retail or a transactor exposure warrants a risk weight of 110 percent.
The following example describes how a banking organization would identify the amount
of retail exposures that could be treated as regulatory retail exposures. First, a banking
organization would identify the amount of credit exposures that meet the eligible products
criterion within the definition of a regulatory retail exposure. Assume a banking organization has
$100 million in total retail exposures that meet the eligible regulatory retail product criterion
described above. Next, for this set of exposures, the banking organization would identify any
amounts to a single obligor and its affiliates that exceed $1 million. The banking organization in
this example determines that a single obligor and its affiliates account for an aggregate of $20
million of the banking organization's total retail exposures. Because this $20 million exceeds the
$1 million threshold for amounts to a single obligor and its affiliates, this $20 million would be
retail exposures that are not regulatory retail exposures and subject to a 110 percent risk weight,
leaving $80 million that could be categorized as regulatory retail exposures.
Also, assume that of the $80 million, $1 million of the exposures are considered defaulted
exposures. This $1 million in defaulted exposures would be subtracted from the $80 million. The
banking organization would multiply the remaining $79 million by the 0.2 percent granularity
limit, with the resulting $158,000 representing the dollar amount equivalent of the granularity
Page 84 of 1089
limit for this banking organization's retail portfolio. Therefore, of the remaining $79 million, the
portion of those retail exposures to a single obligor and its affiliates that do not exceed $158,000
would be considered regulatory retail exposures. Of the regulatory retail exposures, the portion
of the exposure that would qualify as a transactor exposure would receive a 55 percent risk
weight and the remaining portion would receive an 85 percent risk weight. Under the proposal, a
banking organization would assign a 110 percent risk weight to the portion of a retail exposure
that exceeds the granularity limit. Thus, the total amount of retail exposures to a single obligor
exceeding $158,000 in this example would receive a 110 percent risk weight as other retail
exposures. This example is also illustrated in the following decision tree.
1. Identify any credit exposures that meet the
eligible products criterion within the definition
of a regulatory retail exposure.
2. Identify any amounts to a single borrower
and its affiliates that exceed $1 million.
3. Exclude defaulted exposures from the
regulatory retail exposures
4. Apply granular(0.2 percent rule) basis of
measurement.
5. Retail exposures to a single borrower that
do not exceed the 0.2 percent threshold are
considered regulatory retail exposures.
6. Identify the exposure
that would qualify as an
exposure to a transactor*

*A transactor is a borrower who is a natural person or persons
in relation to a credit facility such as a credit card or charge
card where, for each of the previous 12 months, the borrower
has either paid the balance in full at each scheduled repayment
date or has not drawn on the facility. Borrowers under an
overdraft facility also would be considered transactors if there
has been no drawdown over the previous 12 months.
Question 34: What, if any, additional criteria or alternatives should the agencies
consider to help ensure that the regulatory retail treatment is limited to a group of diversified
Page 85 of 1089
retail obligors? What alternative thresholds or calibrations should the agencies consider for
purposes of retail exposures? Please provide supporting data in your response.
Question 35: What simplifications, if any, to the calculation described above for a
regulatory retail exposure should the agencies consider to reduce operational complexity for
banking organizations? For example, what operational challenges would arise from assigning
differing risk weights to portions of retail exposures based on the regulatory retail eligibility
criteria?
Question 36: Is the requirement for repayment of a credit facility in full at each
scheduled repayment date for the previous twelve months or lack of overdraft history an
appropriate criterion to distinguish the credit risk of a transactor exposure from other retail
exposures, and if not, what would be more appropriate and why? Is twelve months of full
repayment history a sufficient amount of time to demonstrate a consistent repayment history of
the credit or overdraft facility to meet the definition of a transactor and if not, what would be an
appropriate amount of time?
g. Risk-weight multiplier for certain retail and residential mortgage exposures with
currency mismatch
The proposal would introduce a new requirement for banking organizations to apply a
multiplier to the applicable risk weight assigned to certain exposures that contain currency
mismatches between the banking organization's lending currency and the borrower's source of
repayment. The multiplier would reflect the borrower's increased risk of default due to the
borrower's exposure to foreign exchange risk. The multiplier would apply to exposure types
where the borrower generally does not manage or hedge its foreign exchange risk. Exposures
Page 86 of 1089
with such currency mismatches pose increased credit risk to the banking organization as the
borrower's repayment ability could be affected by exchange rate fluctuations.
To capture this increased risk, the proposal would require banking organizations to apply
a 1.5 multiplier to the applicable risk weight, subject to a maximum risk weight of 150 percent,
for retail and residential mortgage exposures to a borrower that does not have a source of
repayment in the currency of the loan equal to at least 90 percent of the annual payment from
either income generated through ordinary business activities or from a contract with a financial
institution that provides funds denominated in the currency of the loan, such as a forward
exchange contract. Other types of exposures generally account for foreign exchange risk through
hedging or other risk mitigants and would not be subject to the proposed multiplier. The
proposed risk weight ceiling of 150 percent aligns with the maximum risk weight for credit
exposures under the proposal.
Question 37: What, if any, additional or alternative criteria of the proposed multiplier
should the agencies consider and why?
h. Corporate exposures
A corporate exposure under the proposal would be an exposure to a company that does
not fall under any other exposure category under the proposal. This scope would be consistent
with the definition found in §__.2 of the current capital rule. For example, an exposure to a
corporation that also meets the proposed definition of a real estate exposure would be a real
estate exposure rather than a corporate exposure for purposes of the proposal.
As described in more detail below, the proposal would differentiate the risk weights of
corporate exposures based on credit risk by considering such factors as a corporate exposure's
investment quality and the general creditworthiness of the borrower, level of subordination, as
Page 87 of 1089
well as the nature and substance of the lending arrangement, and the degree of reliance on the
borrower's independent capacity for repayment of the obligation, or reliance on the income that
the borrowing entity is expected to generate from the asset(s) or a project being financed. First, a
banking organization would assign a 65 percent risk weight to a corporate exposure that is an
exposure to a company that is investment grade, and that has a publicly traded security
outstanding or that is controlled by a company that has a publicly traded security outstanding. 94
Second, consistent with the current standardized approach, a banking organization would assign
risk weights of 2 percent or 4 percent to certain exposures to a qualifying central counterparty."
Third, as discussed further below, a banking organization would assign a 130 percent risk weight
to a project finance exposure that is not a project finance operational phase exposure. Fourth, a
banking organization would assign a 150 percent risk weight to a corporate exposure that is an
exposure to a subordinated debt instrument or an exposure to a covered debt instrument unless a
deduction treatment is provided as described in section III.C.2.d. of this Supplementary
Information.
95
Finally, a banking organization would assign a 100 percent risk weight to all other
corporate exposures. Assigning a 100 percent risk weight to all other corporate exposures
appropriately reflects the relative risk of such corporate exposures, as the repayment methods for
these exposures pose greater risks than those of publicly-traded corporate exposures that are
deemed investment grade. A banking organization would also assign a 100 percent risk weight to
⁹4 Under §___.2 of the current capital rule, a person or company controls a company if it: (1)
owns, controls, or holds with power to vote 25 percent or more of a class of voting securities of
the company; or (2) consolidates the company for financial reporting purposes. See 12 CFR 3.2
(OCC); 12 CFR 217.2 (Board); 12 CFR 324.2 (FDIC).
95
See 12 CFR 3.32(f)(2)-(3) (OCC); 12 CFR 217.32(f)(2)-(3) (Board); 12 CFR 324.32(f)(2)-(3)
(FDIC).
Page 88 of 1089
corporate exposures that finance income-producing assets or projects that engage in non-real
estate activities where the obligor has no independent capacity to repay the loan. For example,
corporate exposures subject to the 100 percent risk weight would include exposures (i) for the
purpose of acquiring or financing equipment where repayment of the exposure is dependent on
the cash flows generated by either the equipment being financed or acquired, (ii) for the purpose
of acquiring or financing physical commodities where repayment of the exposure is dependent
on the proceeds from the sale of the physical commodities, and (iii) project finance operational
phase exposures, as further discussed below.
Investment grade companies with publicly traded securities outstanding
Under the proposal, a banking organization would assign a 65 percent risk weight to a
corporate exposure that is both (1) an exposure to a company that is investment grade, and (2)
where that company, or a parent that controls that company, has publicly traded securities
outstanding. This two-pronged test would serve as a reasonable basis for banking organizations
to identify exposures to obligors of sufficient creditworthiness to be eligible for a reduced risk
weight. The definition of investment grade directly addresses the credit quality of the exposure
by requiring that the entity or reference entity have adequate capacity to meet financial
commitments, which means that the risk of its default is low and the full and timely repayment of
principal and interest is expected. A banking organization's investment grade analysis is
dependent upon the banking organization's underwriting criteria, judgment, and assumptions.
i.
96
Under §___.2 of the current capital rule, publicly-traded means traded on: (1) any exchange
registered with the SEC as a national securities exchange under section 6 of the Securities
Exchange Act; or (2) any non-U.S.-based securities exchange that: (i) is registered with, or
approved by, a national securities regulatory authority; and (ii) provides a liquid, two-way
market for the instrument in question. See 12 CFR 3.2 (OCC); 12 CFR 217.2 (Board); 12 CFR
324.2 (FDIC).
Page 89 of 1089
The proposed requirement that the company or its parent company have securities
outstanding that are publicly traded, in contrast, would be a simple, objective criterion that would
provide a degree of consistency across banking organizations. Further, publicly-traded corporate
entities are subject to enhanced transparency and market discipline as a result of being listed
publicly on an exchange. A banking organization would use these simple criteria, which
complement a banking organization's due diligence and internal credit analysis, to determine
whether a corporate exposure qualifies as an investment grade exposure.
Question 38: What, if any, alternative criteria should the agencies consider to identify
corporate exposures that would warrant a risk weight of 65 percent or a risk weight between 65
percent and 100 percent?
Question 39: For what reasons, if any, should the agencies consider applying a lower
risk weight than 100 percent to exposures to companies that are not publicly traded but are
companies that are "highly regulated?" What, if any, criteria should the agencies consider to
identify companies that are "highly regulated?” Alternatively, what are the advantages and
disadvantages of assigning lower risk weights to highly regulated entities (such as open-ended
mutual funds, mutual insurance companies, pension funds, or registered investment companies)?
Question 40: What are the advantages and disadvantages of applying a lower risk weight
(such as between 85 and 100 percent), to entities based on size, such as companies with reported
annual sales of less than or equal to $50 million for the most recent financial year? What
alternative criteria, if any, should the agencies consider to identify small or medium-sized
entities that present lower credit risk? For example, should the agencies consider asset size or
number of employees to identify small or medium-sized entities? Please provide supporting data.
Page 90 of 1089
Question 41: What criteria, if any, should the agencies consider to further differentiate
corporate exposures according to their risk profiles and what implications would such criteria
have for the risk weighting of these exposures and why?
Project finance exposures
The proposal would define a project finance exposure as a corporate exposure for which
the banking organization relies on the revenues generated by a single project (typically a large
and complex installation, such as power plants, manufacturing plants, transportation
infrastructure, telecommunications, or other similar installations), both as the source of
repayment and as security for the loan. For example, a project finance exposure could take the
form of financing the construction of a new installation, or a refinancing of an existing
installation, with or without improvements. The primary determinant of credit risk for a project
finance exposure is the variability of the cash flows expected to be generated by the project being
financed rather than the general creditworthiness of the obligor or the market value or sale of the
project or the real estate on which the project sits.⁹7 A project finance exposure also would be
required to meet the following criteria: (1) the exposure would need to be to a borrowing entity
that was created specifically to finance the project, operate the physical assets of the project, or
do both, and (2) the borrowing entity would need to have an immaterial amount of assets,
activities, or sources of income apart from revenues from the activities of the project being
financed. Under the proposal, an exposure that is deemed secured by real estate,⁹8 would not be
97
98
97
ii.
Exposures that are guaranteed by the government or considered a general obligation or
revenue obligation exposure to a PSE would not qualify as a project finance exposure.
98 Although it is common for the banking organization to take a mortgage over the real property
and a lien against other assets of the project for security and lender control purposes, a project
finance exposure would not be considered a real estate exposure because the banking
organization does not rely on real estate collateral to grant credit. As noted in section III.C.2.e of
Page 91 of 1089
considered a project finance exposure and would be assigned a risk weight as described in
section III.C.2.e. of this Supplementary Information.
Under the proposal, a project finance exposure would receive a 130 percent risk weight
during the pre-operational phase and a 100 percent risk weight during the operational phase. The
proposal would define a project finance operational phase exposure as a project finance exposure
where the project has a positive net cash flow that is sufficient to support the debt service and
expenses of the project and any other remaining contractual obligation, in accordance with the
banking organization's applicable loan underwriting criteria for permanent financings, and where
the outstanding long-term debt of the project is declining. Prior to the operational phase
classification, a banking organization would be required to treat a project finance exposure as
being in the pre-operational phase and assign a 130 percent risk weight to the exposure. The pre-
operational phase would be the period between the origination of the loan and the time at which
the banking organization determines that the project has entered the operational phase. Relative
to the operational phase, the pre-operational phase presents increased uncertainty that the project
will be completed in a timely and cost-effective manner, which warrants the application of a
higher risk weight. For example, market conditions could change significantly between
commencement and completion of the project. In addition, unanticipated supply shortages could
disrupt timely completion of the project and the expected timing of the transition to the
operational phase. These unanticipated changes could disrupt the completion of the project and
this Supplementary Information, for purposes of the proposal, "secured by collateral in the form
of real estate" in the context of the proposed real estate exposure definition should be interpreted
in a manner that is consistent with the current definition for "a loan secured by real estate" in the
Call Report and FR Y-9C instructions.
Page 92 of 1089
delay it becoming operational, and thus impact the ability of the project to generate cash flows as
projected and to repay creditors.
Question 42: What additional exposures, if any, should be captured by the proposed
definition of a project finance exposure? What exposures, if any, captured by the proposed
definition of a project finance exposure should be excluded from the definition?
Question 43: What clarifications or changes, if any, should the agencies consider to
differentiate project finance exposures from exposures secured by real estate? What, if any,
capital market effects would the proposed treatment of project finance exposures have and why
and what, if any, modifications should the agencies consider to address such effects? How
material for banking organizations are project finance exposures that are not based on the
creditworthiness of a federal, state or local government?
3. Off-balance sheet exposures
In addition to on-balance sheet exposures, banking organizations are exposed to credit
risk associated with off-balance sheet exposures. Banking organizations often enter into
contractual arrangements with borrowers or counterparties to provide credit or other support.
Such arrangements generally are not recorded on-balance sheet under GAAP. These off-balance
sheet exposures often include commitments, contingent items, guarantees, certain repo-style
transactions, financial standby letters of credit, and forward agreements.
The proposal would introduce a few updated credit conversion factors that a banking
organization would apply to an off-balance sheet item's notional amount (typically, the
contractual amount) in order to calculate the exposure amount for an off-balance sheet exposure.
Under the proposal, the credit conversion factors, which would range from 10 percent to 100
percent, would reflect the expected proportion of the off-balance sheet item that would become
Page 93 of 1089
an on-balance sheet credit exposure to the borrower, taking into account the contractual features
of the off-balance sheet item. For example, a guarantee provided by a banking organization
would be subject to a 100 percent credit conversion factor because there generally is a high
probability of the full amount of the guarantee becoming an on-balance sheet credit exposure. In
contrast, under the terms of most commitments, banking organizations generally are not expected
to extend the full amount of credit agreed to in the contract. After determining the off-balance
sheet exposure amount, the banking organization would then multiply it by the appropriate risk
weight, as provided under section III.C.2. of the Supplementary Information, to arrive at the risk-
weighted asset amount for the off-balance sheet exposure, consistent with the calculation method
under the current standardized approach.
a. Commitments
The proposal would maintain the existing definition of commitment under the current
capital rule. The current capital rule defines a commitment as any legally binding arrangement
that obligates a banking organization to extend credit or to purchase assets.9⁹ A commitment can
exist even when the banking organization has the unilateral right to not extend credit at any time.
Off-balance sheet exposures such as credit cards allow obligors to borrow up to a
specified amount. However, some off-balance sheet exposures such as charge cards do not have
an explicit contractual pre-set credit limit and generally require obligors to pay their balance in
full each month. For commitments with no express contractual maximum amount or pre-set
limit, the proposal would include an approach to calculate a proxy for the committed but
undrawn amount of the commitment (off-balance sheet notional amount), based on an averaging
formula over the previous two years (averaging methodology). A banking organization would

first calculate the average total drawn amount of the commitment over the prior eight quarters or,
if the banking organization has offered such products to the obligor for fewer than eight quarters,
the average total drawn amount since the commitment with no pre-set limit was first issued. The
banking organization would then multiply the average total drawn amount by 10 to determine the
off-balance sheet notional amount. Next, the banking organization would determine the
applicable off-balance sheet exposure amount by first subtracting the current drawn amount from
the calculated off-balance sheet notional amount and then multiplying this difference by the
applicable credit conversion factor (10 percent for an unconditionally cancelable commitment, as
described in more detail in the following section). The risk-weighted asset amount would be the
off-balance sheet exposure amount multiplied by the applicable risk weight (e.g., 55 percent for a
transactor retail exposure).
For example, assume an obligor's charge card had an average drawn amount of $4,000
over the prior eight quarters, and a drawn amount of $3,000 during the most recent reporting
quarter. To determine the off-balance sheet exposure amount of the charge card, a banking
organization would (1) multiply the average of $4,000 by 10 ($40,000), (2) subtract the current
drawn amount of $3,000 from $40,000 ($37,000), and (3) multiply $37,000 by the 10 percent
credit conversion factor for unconditionally cancellable commitments ($3,700). For purposes of
this example, assume the obligor's charge card would qualify as a regulatory retail exposure ¹00
that is a transactor exposure. Applying the 55 percent risk weight for transactor exposures to the
exposure amount of $3,700. would result in a risk-weighted asset amount of $2,035.
100
As discussed in section III.C.2.f of this Supplementary Information, a retail exposure would
need to meet certain criteria and be evaluated against the aggregate and granularity limits to
qualify as a regulatory retail exposure.
Page 95 of 1089
The proposed averaging methodology would apply a multiplier of 10 to the average total
drawn amount because supervisory experience suggests that obligors similar to those with charge
cards have average credit utilization rates equal to approximately 10 percent. This approach uses
an eight-quarter average balance, as opposed to a shorter period, to better reflect a borrower's
credit usage, notably by mitigating the impact of seasonality and of short-term trends in drawn
balances from the total credit exposure estimate.
Question 44: What are the advantages and disadvantages of the averaging methodology
to calculate a proxy for the undrawn credit exposure amount for commitments with no pre-set
limits? What, if any, adjustments should the agencies consider to better reflect a borrower's
credit usage when calculating the undrawn portion of the credit exposures for commitments that
have less than eight quarters of data, particularly those with less than a full quarter of data?
What, if any, alternative approaches should the agencies consider and why?
Question 45: What adjustments, if any, should the agencies make to the proposed
multiplier of 10 for calculating the total off-balance sheet notional amount of the obligor under
the proposed methodology and why?
b. Credit conversion factors
The proposal would provide the same credit conversion factors in the current capital rule
except with respect to commitments. The proposal would modify the credit conversion factors
applicable to commitments and simplify the treatment relative to the current standardized
approach by no longer differentiating such factors by maturity. Under the proposal, a
commitment, regardless of the maturity of the facility, would be subject to a credit conversion
factor of 40 percent, except for the unused portion of a commitment that is unconditionally
Page 96 of 1089
cancelable 101
(to the extent permitted under applicable law) by the banking organization, which
would be subject to a credit conversion factor of 10 percent. ¹02 Although unconditionally
cancellable commitments allow banking organizations to cancel such commitments at any time
without prior notice, in practice, banking organizations often extend credit or provide funding for
reputational reasons or to support the viability of borrowers to which the banking organization
has significant ongoing exposure, even when borrowers are under economic stress. For example,
banking organizations may have incentives to preserve substantial or core customer relationships
when there is a deterioration in creditworthiness that may, for less substantial customer
relationships, cause the banking organization to cancel a commitment. Relative to the current
standardized approach, the proposal would simplify the applicable credit conversion factor for all
other commitments given the 10 percent applicable credit conversion factor for unconditionally
cancellable commitments. A 40 percent credit conversion factor for other commitments is
appropriate because such commitments do not provide the banking organization the same
flexibility to exit the commitment compared with unconditionally cancellable commitments.
Question 46: What additional factors, if any, should the agencies consider for
determining the applicable credit conversion factors for commitments?
4. Derivatives
101 Under §. 2 of the current capital rule, unconditionally cancelable means a commitment that
a banking organization may, at any time, with or without cause, refuse to extend credit (to the
extent permitted under applicable law). See 12 CFR 3.2 (OCC); 12 CFR 217.2 (Board); 12 CFR
324.2 (FDIC).
102
Under the proposal, a 40 percent CCF would also apply to commitments that are not
unconditionally cancelable commitments for purposes of calculating total leverage exposure for
the supplementary leverage ratio.
Page 97 of 1089
The current capital rule requires banking organizations to calculate risk-weighted assets
based on the exposure amount of their derivative contracts and prescribes different approaches
for measuring the exposure amount of derivative contracts based on the size and risk profile of
the banking organization. The proposal would expand the scope of banking organizations that
would be required to use one of the approaches, SA-CCR, which was adopted in January 2020
(the SA-CCR final rule),¹03 and make certain technical revisions to that approach. The current
capital rule requires banking organizations subject to Category I or II capital standards to utilize
SA-CCR or the internal models methodology to calculate their advanced approaches total risk-
weighted assets and to utilize SA-CCR to calculate standardized total risk-weighted assets.
The current capital rule permits banking organizations subject to Category III or IV capital
standards to utilize the current exposure methodology or SA-CCR to calculate standardized total
risk-weighted assets. 105
As discussed in section II of this Supplementary Information, the proposal would require
institutions subject to Category III or IV capital standards to use the expanded risk-based
approach, which includes the requirement to use SA-CCR, and would eliminate the internal
models methodology as an available approach to calculate the exposure amount of derivative
contracts. Therefore, under the proposal, large banking organizations would be required to use
SA-CCR to calculate regulatory capital ratios under the standardized approach, expanded risk-
based approach, and supplementary leverage ratio.

Page 98 of 1089
The agencies are also proposing technical revisions to SA-CCR to assist banking
organizations in implementing SA-CCR in a consistent manner and with an exposure
measurement that more appropriately reflects the counterparty credit risks posed by derivative
transactions.
a. Proposed technical revisions
i. Treatment of collateral held by a qualifying central counterparty (QCCP)
Under the current capital rule, a clearing member banking organization using SA-CCR
must determine its capital requirement for a default fund contribution to a QCCP based on the
hypothetical capital requirement for the QCCP (KCCP) using SA-CCR.106 The calculation of KCCP
requires calculating the exposure amount of the QCCP to each of its clearing members. In the
calculation of the exposure amount, the SA-CCR final rule allows the exposure amount of the
QCCP to each clearing member to be reduced by all collateral held by the QCCP posted by the
clearing member and by the amount of prefunded default fund contributions provided by the
clearing member to the QCCP. However, this treatment is inconsistent with the calculation of the
exposure amount for a netting set, in which collateral is not subtracted from the exposure amount
but is instead a component of the calculations of both the replacement cost (RC) and potential
future exposure (PFE).
The proposal would change how collateral posted to a QCCP by clearing members and
the amount of clearing members' prefunded default fund contributions factor into the
calculation of Kccp. This treatment, which is more sensitive to the risk-reducing benefits of
collateral, would allow the proper recognition of collateral in calculating the exposure amount
of a QCCP to its clearing members and would be consistent with the calculation of the
106
See 12 CFR 3.133(d) (OCC); 12 CFR 217.133(d) (Board); 12 CFR 324.133(d) (FDIC)
Page 99 of 1089
exposure amount for a netting set. Specifically, for the purpose of calculating the exposure
amount of a QCCP to a clearing member, the net independent collateral amount that appears in
the RC and PFE calculations would be replaced by the sum of:
1) the fair value amount of the independent collateral posted to a QCCP by a
clearing member;
2) the fair value amount of the independent collateral posted to a QCCP by a
clearing member on behalf of a client, in connection with derivative contracts for which
the clearing member has provided a guarantee to the QCCP; and
3) the amount of the prefunded default fund contribution of the clearing member
to the QCCP.
Both the amount of independent collateral and the prefunded default fund contribution
would be adjusted by the standard supervisory haircuts under Table 1 to section .121 of the
proposal, as applicable.
ii. Treatment of collateral held in a bankruptcy-remote manner
Both the standardized approach and the advanced approaches under the current capital
rule require a banking organization to determine the trade exposure amount for derivative
contracts transacted through a central counterparty (CCP).
When calculating its trade exposure amount for a cleared transaction, a banking
organization under both the standardized and advanced approaches under the capital rule may
exclude collateral posted to the CCP that is held in a bankruptcy-remote manner by the CCP or a
custodian. In the SA-CCR final rule, the agencies inadvertently imposed heightened
requirements for the exclusion of collateral from the trade exposure amount posted by a clearing
Page 100 of 1089
member banking organizations to a CCP under the advanced approaches. 107 The expanded risk-
based approach does not include these heightened requirements and would align the
requirements for the exclusion of collateral from the trade exposure amount of banking
organizations under both the standardized and expanded risk-based approach.
111. Supervisory delta for collateralized debt obligation (CDO) tranches
Under the SA-CCR final rule, a banking organization must apply a supervisory delta
adjustment to account for the sensitivity of a derivative contract (scaled to unit size) to the
underlying primary risk factor, including the correct sign (positive or negative) to account for the
direction of the derivative contract amount relative to the primary risk factor.¹
108
For a derivative contract that is a CDO tranche, the supervisory delta adjustment is
calculated using the formula below:
15
(1+14*A)*(1+14*D)
where A is the attachment point and D is the detachment point.
The SA-CCR final rule applies a positive sign to the resulting amount if the banking
organization purchased the CDO tranche and applies a negative sign if the banking organization
sold the CDO tranche. However, the appropriate sign to account for the purchasing or selling of
CDO tranches can be ambiguous: purchasing a CDO tranche can be interpreted as selling credit
Supervisory delta adjustment =
107 12 CFR 3.133(c)(4)(i) (OCC); 12 CFR 217.133(c)(4)(i) (Board); 12 CFR 324.133(c)(4)(i)
(FDIC).
108
For the supervisory delta adjustment, a banking organization applies a positive sign to the
derivative contract amount if the derivative contract is long the risk factor and a negative sign if
the derivative contract is short the risk factor. A derivative contract is long the primary risk
factor if the fair value of the instrument increases when the value of the primary risk factor
increases. A derivative contract is short the primary risk factor if the fair value of the
instrument decreases when the value of the primary risk factor increases.
Page 101 of 1089
protection, while selling a CDO tranche can be interpreted as purchasing credit protection. In
order to ensure the correct sign of the supervisory delta adjustment for CDO tranches that would
result in a proper aggregation of CDO tranches with linear credit derivative contracts in PFE
calculations, the proposal would revise the sign specification for the supervisory delta adjustment
for CDO tranches as follows: positive if the CDO tranches were used to purchase credit
protection by the banking organization and negative if the CDO tranches were used to sell credit
protection by the banking organization.
iv. Supervisory delta for options contracts
Under the SA-CCR final rule, the supervisory delta adjustment for option contracts is
calculated based on the Black-Scholes formulas for delta sensitivity of European call and put
option contracts. The original Black-Scholes formula for a European option contract's delta
sensitivity assumes a lognormal probability distribution for the value of the instrument or risk
factor underlying the option contract, thus precluding negative values for both the current value
of the underlying instrument or risk factor and the strike price of the option contract. The SA-
CCR final rule uses modified Black-Scholes formulas that are based on a shifted lognormal
probability distribution, which allows negative values of the underlying instrument or risk factor
with the magnitude not exceeding the value of a shift parameter λ (lambda). The SA-CCR final
rule sets λ to zero (thus precluding negative values) for all asset classes except the interest rate
asset class, which has exhibited negative values in some currencies in recent years. For the
interest rate asset class, a banking organization must set the value of for a given currency equal
to the greater of (i) the negative of the lowest value of the strike prices and the current values of
the interest rate underlying all interest rate options in a given currency that the banking
organization has with all counterparties plus 0.1 percent; and (ii) zero.
Page 102 of 1089
However, negative values of the instrument or risk factor underlying an option contract
can occur in other asset classes as well. For example, whenever an option contract references the
difference between the values of two instruments or risk factors, the underlying spread of this
option contract can be negative. Such option contracts are commonly traded in the OTC
derivatives market, including option contracts on the spread between two commodity prices and
on the difference performance across two equity indices. Under the current capital rule,
banking organizations cannot calculate the supervisory delta adjustment for any option contract
other than an interest rate derivative contract if the strike price or the current value of the
underlying instrument or risk factor is negative because the SA-CCR final rule only allows a
non-zero value for λ for interest rate derivative contracts. To ensure that a banking organization
is able to calculate the supervisory delta adjustment for option contracts when the underlying
instrument or risk factor has a negative value, the proposal would extend the use of the shift
parameter λ to all asset classes. More specifically, for non-interest-rate asset classes, the proposal
would require a banking organization to use the same value of λ for all option contracts that
reference the same underlying instrument or risk factor. If the value of the underlying instrument
or risk factor cannot be negative, the value of 2 would be set to zero. Otherwise, to determine the
value of λ for a given risk factor or instrument, the proposal would require a banking
organization to find the lowest value L of the strike price and the current value of the underlying
instrument or risk factor of all option contracts that reference this instrument or risk factor with
all counterparties. The proposal would require a banking organization to set λ for this instrument
or risk factor according to the formula λ=max{-1.1·L,0}. The purpose of multiplying negative L
by 1.1 (thus, resulting in -1.1·L) is the same as that for adding 0.1 percent in the case of interest
rate derivative contracts under the SA-CCR final rule: to set the lowest possible value of the
Page 103 of 1089
underlying instrument or risk factor slightly below the lowest observed value. Because it is
challenging to determine a universal additive offset value for all values of non-interest-rate
instruments and risk factors, the offset would be performed via multiplication for asset classes
other than the interest rate asset class.
The proposal would also permit a banking organization, with the approval of its primary
Federal supervisor, to specify a different value for λ for purposes of the supervisory delta
adjustment for option contracts other than interest rate option contracts, if a different value for
would be appropriate, considering the range of values for the instrument or risk factor underlying
option contracts. This flexibility would allow a banking organization to use a specific value for
λ, rather than the value resulting from the proposed formula described above, in the event that a
different value for λ is more appropriate than the value resulting from the formula. A banking
organization that specifies a different value for λ would be required to assign the same value for
λ to all option contracts with the same underlying instrument or risk factor, as applicable, with all
counterparties. This proposed provision is intended to permit a banking organization, with
approval from its primary Federal supervisor, to account for unanticipated outcomes in the
supervisory delta adjustment of certain asset classes while avoiding arbitrage between assets in
that class.
Question 47: What other approaches should the agencies consider to calibrate the
lambda parameter for non-interest-rate asset classes, such as a formula that is different from the
proposed formula of λ=max{-1.1-L,0}, and why? What values besides 1.1, if any, should the
agencies consider for the value of the multiplier in the proposed formula? Why?
Decomposition of credit, equity, and commodity indices
V.
Page 104 of 1089
109
Under the capital rule, banking organizations are permitted to decompose indices within
credit, equity, and commodity asset classes, such that a banking organization would treat each
component of the index as a separate single-name derivative contract. The capital rule requires
that if a banking organization elects to decompose indices within the credit, equity, and
commodity asset classes, the banking organization must perform all calculations in determining
the exposure amount based on the underlying instrument rather than the index. While this is
possible for linear indices, for non-linear index contracts (e.g., those with optionality and CDS
index tranches) it is not mathematically possible to calculate the supervisory delta for an
underlying component, as the delta associated with the non-linear index applies at the instrument
level. In recognition of this fact, the agencies are clarifying that the option to decompose a non-
linear index is not available under SA-CCR. Additionally, the agencies are clarifying that if
electing to decompose a linear index, banking organizations must apply the weights used by the
index when determining the exposure amounts for the underlying instrument.
5. Credit risk mitigation
The current capital rule permits banking organizations to recognize certain types of credit
risk mitigants, such as guarantees, credit derivatives, and collateral, for risk-based capital
purposes provided the credit risk mitigants satisfy the qualification standards under the rule.110
Credit derivatives and guarantees can reduce the credit risk of an exposure by placing a legal
obligation on a third-party protection provider to compensate the banking organization for losses
109
See 12 CFR 3.132(c)(5)(vi) (OCC); 12 CFR 217.132(c)(5)(vi) (Board); 12 CFR
324.132(c)(5)(vi) (FDIC).
110 Consistent with the current capital rule, the proposal would not require banking organizations
to recognize any instrument as a credit risk mitigant. Credit derivatives that a banking
organization cannot or chooses not to recognize as a credit risk mitigant would be subject to a
separate counterparty credit risk capital requirement.
Page 105 of 1089
in the event of a borrower default.¹¹¹ Similarly, the use of collateral can reduce the credit risk of
an exposure by creating the right of a banking organization to take ownership of and liquidate the
collateral in the event of a default by the counterparty. Prudent use of such mitigants can help a
banking organization reduce the credit risk of an exposure and thereby reduce the risk-based
capital requirement associated with that exposure.
Credit risk mitigants recognized for risk-based capital purposes must be of sufficiently
high quality to effectively reduce credit risk. For guarantees and credit derivatives, the current
capital rule primarily looks to the creditworthiness of the guarantor and the features of the
underlying contract to determine whether these forms of credit risk mitigation may be recognized
for risk-based capital purposes (eligible guarantee or eligible credit derivative). With respect to
collateralized transactions, the current capital rule primarily looks to the liquidity profile and
quality of the collateral received and the nature of the banking organization's security interest to
determine whether the collateral qualifies as financial collateral that may be recognized for
purposes of risk-based capital.¹12
As stated earlier, the proposal would eliminate the use of models for credit risk under the
current capital rule. Therefore, the proposal would replace certain methodologies for recognizing
the risk-reducing benefits of financial collateral and eligible guarantees and credit derivatives—
namely, the internal models methodology, simple VaR approach, PD substitution approach, LGD
adjustment approach, and double default treatment with the standardized approaches described
below. For eligible guarantees and eligible credit derivatives, the proposal would permit banking
111 Credit events are defined in the documents governing the credit risk mitigant and often
include events such as failure to pay principal and interest and entry into insolvency or similar
proceedings.
112
See 12 CFR 3.2, 217.2, and 324.2 for the definition of financial collateral.
Page 106 of 1089
organizations to use the substitution approach from subpart D of the current capital rule with a
modification for eligible credit derivatives that do not include restructuring as a credit event.
Further, the proposal would no longer permit the recognition of credit protection from nth-to-
default credit derivatives.113 For all collateralized transactions, the corporate issuer of any
financial collateral in the form of a corporate debt security must have an outstanding publicly
traded security or the corporate issuer must be controlled by a company that has an outstanding
publicly traded security in order to be recognized. For collateralized transactions where financial
collateral secures exposures that are not derivative contracts or netting sets of derivative
contracts, the proposal would permit banking organizations to use the simple approach from
subpart D without any modification. For eligible margin loans and repo-style transactions, the
proposal would also permit banking organizations to use the collateral haircut approach with
standard supervisory market price volatility haircuts¹ from subpart D with two proposed
modifications to increase risk sensitivity: (1) adjustments to the market price volatility haircuts
and (2) a modified formula for netting sets of eligible margin loans or repo-style transactions that
reflects netting and diversification benefits within netting sets. Finally, the proposal would
introduce minimum haircut floors for certain eligible margin loan and repo-style transactions
with unregulated financial institutions that banking organizations must meet in order to recognize
the risk-mitigation benefits of financial collateral.
In connection with the removal of the internal models methodology, the proposal would
make corresponding revisions to reflect this change in the definition of a netting set. Compared
,114
113
See section III.D.3.a of this Supplementary Information.
Under subpart D, banking organizations also are permitted to use their own estimates of
market price volatility haircuts, with prior written approval from the primary federal supervisors.
The proposal would not include this option in subpart E as the agencies have found it to
introduce unwarranted variability in banking organizations' risk-weighted assets.
114
Page 107 of 1089
to the current capital rule, the proposal would exclude cross-product netting sets from the
definition of a netting set, as none of the proposed approaches under the revised framework
would recognize cross-product netting. This would be consistent with the current capital rule,
which also does not recognize cross-product netting. Therefore, the proposal would define a
netting set as a group of single-product transactions with a single counterparty that are subject to
a qualifying master netting agreement (QMNA)¹¹5 and that consist only of one of the following:
derivative contracts, repo-style transactions, or eligible margin loans. For purposes of the
proposed netting set definition, the netting set must include the same product (i.e., all derivative
contracts or all repo-style transactions or all eligible margin loans). Consistent with the current
capital rule, for derivative contracts, the proposed definition of netting set would also include a
single derivative contract between a banking organization and a single counterparty.
Question 48: What would be the impact of requiring that certain debt securities must be
issued by a publicly-traded company, or issued by a company controlled by a publicly-traded
company, in order to qualify as financial collateral and what, if any, alternatives should the
agencies consider to this requirement?
a. Guarantees and credit derivatives
i. Substitution approach
As under subpart D in the current capital rule, under the proposal a banking organization
would be permitted to recognize the credit-risk-mitigation benefits of eligible guarantees and
115
See 12 CFR 3.2, 217.2, and 324.2 for the definition of qualifying master netting agreement.
Page 108 of 1089
eligible credit derivatives by substituting the risk weight applicable to the eligible guarantor or
protection provider for the risk weight applicable to the hedged exposure.116
ii. Adjustment for credit derivatives without restructuring as a credit event
Credit derivative contracts in certain jurisdictions include debt restructuring as a credit
event that triggers a payment obligation by the protection provider to the protection purchaser.
Such restructurings of the hedged exposure may involve forgiveness or postponement of
principal, interest, or fees that result in a loss to investors. Consistent with the current capital
rule, the proposal would generally require a banking organization that seeks to recognize the
credit risk-mitigation benefits of an eligible credit derivative that does not include a restructuring
of the reference exposure as a credit event to reduce the effective notional amount of the credit
derivative by 40 percent to account for any unmitigated losses that could occur as a result of a
restructuring of the hedged exposure.
Under the proposal, however, the 40 percent adjustment would not apply to eligible credit
derivatives without restructuring as a credit event if both of the following requirements are
satisfied: (1) the terms of the hedged exposure (and the reference exposure, if different from the
hedged exposure) allow the maturity, principal, coupon, currency, or seniority status to be
amended outside of receivership, insolvency, liquidation, or similar proceeding only by
unanimous consent of all parties; and (2) the banking organization has conducted sufficient legal
review to conclude with a well-founded basis (and maintains sufficient written documentation of
that legal review) that the hedged exposure is subject to the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or a domestic
116 Under subpart E in the current capital rule, an eligible guarantee need not be issued by an
eligible guarantor unless the exposure is a securitization exposure. The proposal would require
all eligible guarantees to be issued by an eligible guarantor.
Page 109 of 1089
or foreign insolvency regime with similar features that allows for a company to reorganize or
restructure and provides for an orderly settlement of creditor claims.
The unanimous consent requirement would mean that, for restructurings occurring
outside of an insolvency proceeding, all holders of the hedged exposure (and the reference
exposure, if different from the hedged exposure) must agree to any restructuring for the
restructuring to occur, and no holder can vote against the restructuring or abstain. This
unanimous consent requirement would reduce the risk that a banking organization would suffer a
credit loss on the hedged exposure that would not be offset by a payment under the eligible credit
derivative. Banking organizations generally would only be incentivized to vote for a
restructuring if the terms of the restructuring would provide a more beneficial outcome to the
banking organization relative to insolvency proceedings that would trigger payment under the
eligible credit derivative. Additionally, the unanimous consent requirement for the reference
exposure, if different from the hedged exposure, would add an additional layer of security by
significantly reducing the probability of reaching a restructuring agreement that results in a loss
of principal or interest for creditors without triggering payment under the eligible credit
derivative. The unanimous consent requirement would need to be satisfied through the terms of
the hedged exposure (and the reference exposure, if different from the hedged exposure), which
could be accomplished through a contractual provision of the exposure or the application of law.
The requirement that the hedged exposure be subject to the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or a
similar domestic or foreign insolvency regime would help to ensure that any restructuring is done
in an orderly, predictable, and regulated process. In the event that the obligor of the hedged
exposure defaults and the default is not cured, the obligor would either be required to enter
insolvency proceedings, which would trigger payment under the credit derivative, or the obligor
Page 110 of 1089
would be required to pursue restructuring outside of insolvency, which could not occur without
the banking organization's consent. Together, the proposed requirements would ensure that
credit derivatives that do not include restructuring as a credit event but provide similarly
effective protection as those that do contain such provisions, are afforded similar recognition
under the capital framework.
Question 49: The agencies seek comment on the appropriateness of allowing banking
organizations to recognize in full the effective notional amount of credit derivatives that do not
include restructuring as a credit event, if certain conditions are met. Is the exemption from the
40 percent haircut overly broad? If so, why, and how might the exemption be narrowed to only
capture the types of credit derivatives that provide protection similar to credit derivatives that
include restructuring as a credit event?
Question 50: To what extent is the proposed treatment of eligible credit derivatives that
do not include restructuring of the reference exposure as a credit event relevant outside of the
United States?
b. Collateralized transactions
The proposal would only allow a banking organization to recognize the risk-mitigating
benefits of a corporate debt security that meets the definition of financial collateral in expanded
risk-weighted assets if the corporate issuer of the debt security has a publicly traded security
outstanding or is controlled by a company that has a publicly traded security outstanding.
Corporations with publicly traded securities typically are subject to mandatory regulatory and
public reporting and disclosure requirements, and therefore debt securities issued by such
corporations may be a more stable and liquid form of collateral.
i. Simple approach
Page 111 of 1089
Subpart D of the current capital rule includes the simple approach, which allows a
banking organization to recognize the risk-mitigating benefits of financial collateral received by
substituting the risk weight applicable to an exposure with the risk weight applicable to the
financial collateral securing the exposure, generally subject to a 20 percent floor. The proposal
generally would maintain the simple approach of the current capital rule, including restrictions
on collateral eligibility and the risk-weight floor, except for the proposed requirement for certain
corporate debt securities.
ii. Collateral haircut approach
Under the current capital rule, a banking organization may recognize the credit risk-
mitigation benefits of repo-style transactions, eligible margin loans, and netting sets of such
transactions by adjusting its exposure amount to its counterparty to recognize any financial
collateral received and any collateral posted to the counterparty. Subpart E of the current capital
rule includes several approaches that a banking organization may use and some of those
approaches include the use of models that contribute to variability in risk-weighted assets. For
this reason, under the proposal a banking organization would no longer be allowed to use the
simple VaR approach or the internal models methodology to calculate the exposure amount, nor
would a banking organization be permitted to use its own internal estimates for calculating
haircuts. The proposal would broadly retain the collateral haircut approach with standard
supervisory market volatility haircuts with some modifications. This approach would require a
banking organization to adjust the fair value of the collateral received and posted to account for
any potential market price volatility in the value of the collateral during the margin period of
risk, as well as to address any differences in currency. To increase the risk-sensitivity of the
collateral haircut approach, the proposal would modify certain market price volatility haircuts.
Page 112 of 1089
The proposal would also introduce a new method to calculate the exposure amount of eligible
transactions in a netting set and simplify the existing exposure calculation method for individual
transactions that are not part of a netting set.
Exposure amount
The proposal would provide two methods for calculating the exposure amount under the
collateral haircut approach for eligible margin loans and repo-style transactions. One method
would apply to individual eligible margin loans and repo-style transactions, the other to single-
product netting sets of such transactions, as described below. The new formula for netting sets
would allow for the recognition of the risk-mitigating benefits of netting and portfolio
diversification and is intended to provide for increased risk-sensitivity of the capital requirement
for such transactions relative to the current capital rule.
I.
Exposure amount for transactions not in a netting set
Under the collateral haircut approach, the proposed exposure amount for an individual
eligible margin loan or repo-style transaction that is not part of a netting set would yield the same
result as the exposure amount equation in the current capital rule. However, the proposal would
change the variables and structure to provide a simplified calculation for an individual eligible
margin loan or repo-style transaction in comparison with transactions that are part of a netting
set. Specifically, the proposal would require a banking organization to calculate the exposure
amount as the greater of zero and the difference of the following two quantities: (1) the value of
the exposure, adjusted by the market price volatility haircut applicable to the exposure for a
potential increase in the exposure amount; and (2) the value of the collateral, adjusted by the
market price volatility haircut applicable to the collateral for a potential decrease in the collateral
value and the currency mismatch haircut applicable where the currency of the collateral is

different from the settlement currency. The banking organization would use the market price
volatility haircuts and a standard 8 percent currency mismatch haircut, subject to adjustments, as
described in the following section. Specifically, the exposure amount for an individual eligible
margin loan or repo-style transaction that is not in a netting set would be based on the following
formula:
Where:
●
●
E* = max{0; E × (1 + H₂) − C × (1 − Hc — Hƒx)}
E* is the exposure amount of the transaction after credit risk mitigation.
E is the current fair value of the specific instrument, cash, or gold the banking
organization has lent, sold subject to repurchase, or posted as collateral to the
counterparty.
He is the haircut appropriate to E as described in Table 1, as applicable.
C is the current fair value of the specific instrument, cash, or gold the banking
organization has borrowed, purchased subject to resale, or taken as collateral from
the counterparty.
He is the haircut appropriate to C as described in Table 1, as applicable.
C
Hƒ is the haircut appropriate for currency mismatch between the collateral and

exposure.
The first component in the above formula, E × (1 + H₂), would capture the current
value of the specific instrument, cash, or gold the banking organization has lent, sold subject to
repurchase, or posted as collateral to the counterparty by the banking organization in the eligible
margin loan or repo-style transaction, while accounting for the market price volatility of the
instrument type. The second component in the above formula, C × (1 – Hc — Hƒx), would
Page 114 of 1089
capture the current value of the specific instrument, cash, or gold the banking organization has
borrowed, purchased subject to resale, or taken as collateral from the counterparty in the eligible
margin loan or repo-style transaction, while accounting for the market price volatility of the
specific instrument as well as any adjustment to reflect currency mismatch, if applicable.
B. Exposure amount for transactions in a netting set
Under the collateral haircut approach, the proposal would provide a new, more risk-
sensitive equation that recognizes diversification benefits by taking into consideration the
number of securities included in a netting set of eligible margin loans or repo-style transactions.
Under this approach, the exposure amount for a netting set of eligible margin loans or repo-style
transactions would equal:
E* = max 0;

counterparty.
C₁ is the current fair value of the instrument, cash, or gold the banking
organization has borrowed, purchased subject to resale, or taken as collateral from
the counterparty.
net exposure = Es EsH₂|
Page 115 of 1089
●
●
gross exposure = Σs Es|H₂|
Es is the absolute value of the net position in a given instrument or in gold (where
the net position in a given instrument or gold equals the sum of the current fair
values of the instrument or gold the banking organization has lent, sold subject to
repurchase, or posted as collateral to the counterparty, minus the sum of the
current fair values of that same instrument or gold the banking organization has
borrowed, purchased subject to resale, or taken as collateral from the
counterparty).
Hè is the haircut appropriate to Es as described in Table 1, as applicable. Hè has a
positive sign if the instrument or gold is net lent, sold subject to repurchase, or
posted as collateral to the counterparty; He has a negative sign if the instrument or
gold is net borrowed, purchased subject to resale, or taken as collateral from the
counterparty.
N is the number of instruments in the netting set with a unique Committee on
Uniform Securities Identification Procedures (CUSIP) designation or foreign
equivalent, with certain exceptions. N would include any instrument with a unique
CUSIP that the banking organization lends, sells subject to repurchase, or posts as
collateral, as well as any instrument with a unique CUSIP that the banking
organization borrows, purchases subject to resale, or takes as collateral. However,
N would not include collateral instruments that the banking organization is not
permitted to include within the credit risk mitigation framework (such as
nonfinancial collateral that is not part of a repo-style transaction included in the
banking organization's market risk weighted assets) or elects not to include within
Page 116 of 1089
the credit risk mitigation framework. The number of instruments for N would also
not include any instrument (or gold) for which the value Es is less than one-tenth
of the value of the largest Es in the netting set. Any amount of gold would be
given a value of one.
Efx is the absolute value of the net position in each currency fx different from the
settlement currency.
Hƒ is the haircut appropriate for currency mismatch of currency fx.
The first component in the above formula, (Σ; E¡ — Σ; C;), would capture the baseline
exposure of a netting set of eligible margin loans or repo-style transactions after accounting for
the value of any collateral. The second, (0.4 × netexposure), and third, (0.6 ×

components in the above formula would reflect the systematic risk (based on the net exposure)
117
and the idiosyncratic risk¹¹7 (based on the gross exposure) of the netting set of eligible margin
loans or repo-style transactions covered by a QMNA. Under the proposal, the net exposure
component would allow the formula to recognize netting at the level of the netting set and
correlations in the movement of market prices for instruments lent and received. Additionally,
because the contribution from the gross exposure component to the exposure amount would
decrease proportionally with an increase in the number of unique instruments by CUSIP
designations or foreign equivalent, the gross exposure would capture the impact of portfolio
diversification. The fourth component, (Σfx(Eƒx × Hƒx)), would capture any adjustment to
reflect currency mismatch, if applicable.
Systematic risk represents risks that are impacted by broad market variables (such as
economy, region, and sector). Idiosyncratic risk represents risks that are endemic to a specific
asset, borrower, or counterparty.
Page 117 of 1089
When determining the market price volatility and currency mismatch haircuts, the
banking organization would use the market price volatility haircuts described in the following
section and a standard 8 percent currency mismatch haircut, subject to certain adjustments.
Question 51: What are the advantages and disadvantages of the proposed methodology
for calculating the exposure amount for eligible margin loans and repo-style transactions
covered by a QMNA?
Question 52: What would be the advantages and disadvantages of an alternative method
to calculate the number of instruments N based on the number of legal entities that issued or
guaranteed the instruments?
II.
Market price volatility haircuts
Under the proposal, a banking organization would apply the market price volatility
haircut appropriate for the type of collateral, as provided in Table 1 below, in the exposure
amount calculation for repo-style transactions, eligible margin loans, and netting sets thereof
using the collateral haircut approach and in the calculation of the net independent collateral
amount and the variation margin amount for collateralized derivative transactions using SA-
CCR. Consistent with the current capital rule, the proposal would require banking organizations
to apply an 8 percent supervisory haircut, subject to adjustments, to the absolute value of the net
position in each currency that is different from the settlement currency.

fund.
This category also would include public sector entities that are treated as sovereigns by the

The proposed haircuts would strike a balance between simplicity and risk sensitivity
relative to the supervisory haircuts in the current capital rule by introducing additional
granularity with respect to residual maturity, which is a meaningful driver for distinguishing
between the market price volatility of different instruments, and by streamlining other aspects of
the collateral haircut approach where the exposure's risk weight figures less prominently in the
instrument's market price volatility, as described below.
The proposal would apply haircuts based solely on residual maturity, rather than a
combination of residual maturity and underlying risk weight as under the current capital rule for
investment grade debt securities other than sovereign debt securities. These haircuts are derived
from observed stress volatilities during 10-business day periods during the 2008 financial crisis.
Debt securities with longer maturities are subject to higher price volatility from future changes in
both interest rates and the creditworthiness of the issuer.
Because securitization exposures tend to be more volatile than corporate debt,¹20 the
proposal would provide a distinct category of market price volatility haircuts for certain
securitization exposures consistent with the current capital rule. The proposal would distinguish
between non-senior and senior securitization exposures to enhance risk sensitivity. Since senior
securitization exposures absorb losses only after more junior securitization exposures, these
exposures have an added layer of security and different market price volatility. Therefore, the
119
Includes senior securitization exposures with a risk weight greater than or equal to 100
percent and sovereign exposures with a risk weight greater than 100 percent.
120 See Basel Committee, “Strengthening the resilience of the banking sector - consultative
document," December 2009; https://www.bis.org/publ/bcbs164.pdf.
Page 120 of 1089
proposal would only specify term-based haircuts for investment grade senior securitization
exposures that receive a risk weight of less than 100 percent under the securitization framework.
Other securitization exposures would receive the 30 percent market price volatility haircut
applicable to "other" exposure types.
The proposal would require a banking organization to apply market price volatility
haircuts of 20 percent for main index equities (including convertible bonds) and gold, 30 percent
for other publicly traded equities and convertible bonds, and 30 percent for other exposure types.
Equities in a main index typically are more liquid than those that are not included in a main
index, as investors may seek to replicate the index by purchasing the referenced equities or
engaging in derivative transactions involving the index or equities within the index. The lower
haircuts for equities included in a main index under the proposal would reflect the higher
liquidity of those securities compared to other publicly traded equities or exposure types, which
would generally help to reduce losses to banking organizations when liquidating those securities
during stress conditions.
For collateral in the form of mutual fund shares, the proposal would be consistent with
the collateral haircut approach provided in the current capital rule in which a banking
organization would apply the highest haircut applicable to any security in which the fund can
invest. The proposal also would include an alternative method available to a banking
organization if the mutual fund qualifies for the full look-through approach described in section
III.E.1.c.ii. of this Supplementary Information. This alternative method would provide a more
risk-sensitive calculation of the haircut on mutual fund shares collateral by using the weighted
Page 121 of 1089
average of haircuts applicable to the instruments held by the mutual fund.¹2¹ This aspect of the
proposal reflects the agencies' observation that, while certain mutual funds may be authorized to
hold a wide range of investments, the actual holdings of mutual funds are often more limited.
In addition, the proposal would maintain the requirement for a banking organization to
apply a market price volatility haircut of 30 percent to address the potential market price
volatility for any instruments that the banking organization has lent, sold subject to repurchase,
or posted as collateral that is not of a type otherwise specified in Table 1.
Question 53: What are the advantages and disadvantages of allowing banking
organizations to apply the full look-through approach for certain collateral in the form of mutual
fund shares? What alternative approaches should the agencies consider for banking
organizations to determine the market price volatility haircuts for collateral in the form of
mutual fund shares?
III.
Minimum haircut floors for certain eligible margin loans and repo-style
transactions
The proposed framework for minimum haircuts on non-centrally cleared securities
financing transactions would reflect the risk exposure of banking organizations to non-bank
financial entities that employ leverage and engage in maturity transformation but that are not
subject to prudential regulation.
121 If the mutual fund qualifies for the full look-through approach described in section III.E.1.c.ii
of this Supplementary Information but would be treated as a market risk covered position as
described in section III.H.3 of this Supplementary Information if the banking organization held
the mutual fund directly, the banking organization is permitted to apply the alternative method to
calculate the haircut.
Page 122 of 1089
The absence of prudential regulation makes such entities more vulnerable to runs, leading
to an increase in the credit risk of these entities in the form of a greater risk of default in stress
periods.¹22 Episodes of non-bank financial entities' distress, such as the 2008 financial crisis,
have highlighted banking organizations' exposure to non-bank financial entities through
securities financing transactions, which may give rise to credit and liquidity risks.
Securities financing transactions may include repo-style transactions and eligible margin
loans. The motivation behind a specific securities financing transaction can be either to lend or
borrow cash, or to lend or borrow a security. Securities financing transactions can be used by a
counterparty to achieve significant leverage – for example, through transactions where the
primary purpose is to finance a counterparty through the lending of cash – and result in elevated
counterparty credit risk.
The proposal would require a banking organization to receive a minimum amount of
collateral when undertaking certain repo-style transactions and eligible margin loans (in-scope
transactions) with such entities (unregulated financial institutions). The application of haircut
floors would determine the minimum amount of collateral exchanged. A banking organization
would treat in-scope transactions with unregulated financial institutions that do not meet the
proposed haircut floors as repo-style transactions or eligible margin loans where the banking
organization did not receive any collateral from its counterparty. The proposed treatment is
intended to limit the build-up of excessive leverage outside the banking system and reduce the
123
122 See "Strengthening Oversight and Regulation of Shadow Banking," Financial Stability Board,
August 2013 https://www.fsb.org/wp-content/uploads/r_130829b.pdf.
123 In this example, the banking organization would be permitted to calculate the exposure
amount using the collateral haircut approach but would be required to exclude any collateral
received from the calculation. Alternatively, the banking organization could choose not to use
the collateral haircut approach but to risk weight any on-balance sheet or off-balance sheet
portions of the exposure as demonstrated in the example below.
Page 123 of 1089
cyclicality of such leverage, thereby limiting risk to the lending banking organization and the
banking system.
Unregulated financial institutions
Consistent with the definition in §_ 2 of the current capital rule, the proposal would
define unregulated financial institution as a financial institution that is not a regulated financial
institution, including any financial institution that would meet the definition of “financial
institution" under section §.2 of the current capital rule but for the ownership interest
thresholds set forth in paragraph (4)(i) of that definition. Unregulated financial institutions would
include hedge funds and private equity firms. This definition would capture non-bank financial
entities that employ leverage and engage in maturity transformation but that are not subject to
prudential regulation.
A.
Question 54: What entities should be included or excluded from the scope of entities
subject to the minimum haircut floors and why? For example, what would be the advantages and
disadvantages of expanding the definition of entities that are scoped-in to include all
counterparties, or all counterparties other than QCCPs? What impact would expanding the
scope of entities subject to the minimum haircut floors have on banking organizations' business
models, competitiveness, or ability to intermediate in funding markets and in U.S. Treasury
securities markets?
B.
In-scope transactions
Under the proposal, an in-scope transaction generally would include the following non-
centrally cleared transactions: (1) an eligible margin loan or a repo-style transaction in which a
banking organization lends cash to an unregulated financial institution in exchange for securities,
unless all of the securities are non-defaulted sovereign exposures, and (2) certain security-for-
Page 124 of 1089
security repo-style transactions that are collateral upgrade transactions with an unregulated
financial institution. Under the proposal, a collateral upgrade transaction would include a
transaction in which the banking organization lends one or more securities that, in aggregate, are
subject to a lower haircut floor in Table 2 than the securities received from the unregulated
financial institution.
The proposal would exempt the following types of transactions and netting sets of such
transactions with unregulated financial institutions from the minimum haircut floor requirements:
(1) transactions in which an unregulated financial institution lends, sells subject to repurchase, or
posts as collateral securities to a banking organization in exchange for cash and the unregulated
financial institution reinvests the cash at the same or a shorter maturity than the original
transaction with the banking organization; (2) collateral upgrade transactions in which the
unregulated financial institution is unable to re-hypothecate, or contractually agrees that it will
not re-hypothecate, the securities it receives as collateral; or (3) transactions in which a banking
organization borrows securities from an unregulated financial institution for the purpose of
meeting current or anticipated demand, such as for delivery obligations, customer demand, or
segregation requirements, and not to provide financing to the unregulated financial institution.
For transactions that are cash-collateralized in which an unregulated financial institution lends
securities to the banking organization, banking organizations could rely on representations made
by the unregulated financial institution as to whether the unregulated financial institution
reinvests the cash at the same or a shorter maturity than the maturity of the transaction. For
transactions in which a banking organization is seeking to borrow securities from an unregulated
financial institution to meet a current or anticipated demand, banking organizations must
maintain sufficient written documentation that such transactions are for the purpose of meeting a
Page 125 of 1089
current or anticipated demand and not for providing financing to an unregulated financial
institution. The proposal would exclude these in-scope transactions from the minimum haircut
floors as these transactions do not pose the same credit and liquidity risks as other in-scope
transactions and serve as important liquidity and intermediation services provided by banking
organizations.
Question 55: What alternative definitions of "in-scope transactions" should the agencies
consider? For example, what would be the pros and cons of an expanded definition of "in-scope
transactions" to include all eligible margin loan or repo-style transactions in which a banking
organization lends cash, including those involving sovereign exposures as collateral? How
would the inclusion of sovereign exposures affect the market for those securities? What, if any,
additional factors should the agencies consider concerning this alternative definition?
Question 56: What, if any, difficulties would banking organizations have in identifying
transactions that would be exempt from the minimum haircut floor?
Question 57: What, if any, operational burdens would be imposed by the proposal to
require banking organizations to maintain sufficient written documentation to exempt
transactions with an unregulated financial institution where the banking organization is seeking
to borrow securities from an unregulated financial institution to meet a current or anticipated
demand?
C. Application of the minimum haircut floors
For in-scope transactions, the proposal would establish minimum haircut floors that
would be applied on a single-transaction or a portfolio basis depending on whether the in-scope
transaction is part of a netting set. The proposed haircut floors are derived from observed
historical price volatilities as well as existing market and central bank haircut conventions. If the
Page 126 of 1089
in-scope transaction is a single transaction, then the banking organization would apply the
corresponding single-transaction haircut floor. If the in-scope transaction is part of a netting set,
the banking organization would apply a portfolio-based floor to the entire netting set. In-scope
transactions that do not meet the applicable minimum haircut floor would be treated as
uncollateralized exposures.
124
The minimum haircut floors are intended to reflect the minimum amount of collateral
banking organizations should receive when undertaking in-scope transactions with unregulated
financial institutions. Banking organizations should require an appropriate amount of collateral
to be provided to account for the risks of the transaction and counterparty. Figure 1 provides a
summary of the process for determining whether an in-scope transaction meets the applicable
minimum haircut floor.

If a netting set contains both in-scope and out-of-scope transactions, the banking organization
would apply a portfolio-based floor for the entire netting set.

The proposal would require a banking organization to compare the haircut (H) and a
single-transaction or portfolio haircut floor (f), as calculated below, to determine whether an in-
scope transaction or a netting set of in-scope transactions meets the relevant floor. If H is less
than f, then the banking organization may not recognize the risk-mitigating effects of any
financial collateral that secures the exposure.
For a single cash-lent-for-security in-scope transaction, H would be defined as the ratio
of the fair value of financial collateral borrowed, purchased subject to resale, or taken as
collateral from the counterparty to the fair value of cash lent, minus one, and f would be the
corresponding haircut applicable to the collateral in Table 2. For example, for an in-scope
transaction in which a banking organization lends $100 in cash to an unregulated financial
institution and receives $102 in investment-grade corporate bonds with a residual maturity of 10
years as collateral, the haircut would be calculated as H = 1 = 2 percent. The single-
transaction haircut floor for an investment grade corporate bond with a residual maturity of 10
years or less under Table 2 would be f = 3 percent. Since the haircut is less than the single-
102
100
Page 128 of 1089
transaction haircut floor (H = 2 percent < 3 percent = f), the proposal would not allow the
banking organization to recognize the risk-mitigating benefits of the collateral and would require
the banking organization to calculate the exposure amount of its repo-style transaction or eligible
margin loan as if it had not received any collateral from its counterparty.
For a single security-for-security repo-style transaction, H would be defined as the ratio
of the fair value of financial collateral borrowed, purchased subject to resale, or taken as
collateral from the counterparty (B) relative to the fair value of the financial collateral the
banking organization has lent, sold subject to repurchase, or posted as collateral to the
counterparty (L), minus one. The single-transaction haircut floor (f) of the transaction would
incorporate the corresponding haircut applicable to the collateral received (f) and collateral lent
(f) in Table 2. The single-transaction haircut floor for the two types of collateral would be
computed as follows:
ƒ = ((1 + (0) / (1+1)) - 1
The single transaction floor then would be compared to the haircut of the transaction,
determined as follows:
H=CB-1
where CB denotes the fair value of collateral received and CL the fair value of collateral
lent. For example, for a securities lending transaction in which a banking organization lends
$100 in investment grade corporate bonds with a residual maturity of 10 years (which correspond
to a haircut floor of 3 percent) and receives $102 in main index equity securities (which
correspond to a haircut floor of 6 percent) as collateral, the haircut would be H

2 percent. The single-transaction haircut floor would be f =
1+6%
1+3%

- 1 = 2.9126 percent. Since
Page 129 of 1089
the haircut is less than the single-transaction haircut floor (H = 2 percent < 2.9126 percent
f), the banking organization would not be able to recognize the risk-mitigating benefits of the
collateral received and would be required to calculate the exposure amount of its repo-style
transaction or eligible margin loan as if it had not received any collateral from its counterparty.
For a netting set of in-scope transactions, the haircut floor of the netting set would be
computed as follows:
f₂)) (Σ(CB /(1+
*Portfolio = ((ECC, /(L + f.)))/(ECB ((1 + fn)))
· 1
Σ CL
Σ CB
as:
In the above formula, C₁ would be the fair value of the net position in each security or in
cash that is net lent, sold subject to repurchase, or posted as collateral to the counterparty; CB is
the fair value of the net position that is net borrowed, purchased subject to resale, or taken as
collateral from the counterparty; and ƒ₁ and ƒ would be the haircut floors for the securities or
cash, as applicable, that are net lent and net borrowed, respectively. ¹25 This calculation would be
the weighted average haircut floor of the portfolio. The portfolio haircut H would be calculated
= (Σ CB / EC₁) - 1
The portfolio would satisfy the minimum haircut floor requirement where the following
condition is satisfied:
=
H =
H> fportfolio
125
For a given security or cash, a banking organization may collect the security or cash in one
transaction and post it in another. Thus, at the portfolio level, the banking organization may, after
netting across all transactions in the same portfolio, be either collecting the security or cash (that
is, net borrowed) or posting the security or cash (that is, net lent).
Page 130 of 1089
If the portfolio does not satisfy the minimum haircut floor, the banking organization
would not be able to recognize the risk-mitigating benefits of the collateral received.
In the following example, there are two in-scope repo-style transactions that are in the
same netting set: (1) a reverse repo transaction in which a banking organization lends $100 in
cash to an unregulated financial institution and receives $102 in investment grade corporate
bonds with a residual maturity of 10 years (which correspond to a haircut floor of 3 percent) as
collateral; and (2) a securities lending transaction in which a banking organization lends $100 of
different investment grade corporate bonds also with a residual maturity of 10 years and receives
$104 in main index equity securities (which correspond to a haircut floor of 6 percent) as
collateral. For this set of in-scope repo-style transactions, the portfolio haircut would be H =
1 = 3 percent. The portfolio haircut floor would be: fportfolio

In a similar example, there are also two in-scope repo-style transactions that are in the
same netting set: (1) a reverse repo transaction in which a banking organization lends $100 in
cash to an unregulated financial institution and receives $101 in investment grade corporate
bonds with a residual maturity of 10 years (which correspond to a haircut floor of 3 percent) as
collateral; and (2) a securities lending transaction in which a banking organization lends $100 of

=
2.9642 percent. Since the portfolio haircut is less than the portfolio haircut floor (H =
1.5 percent < 2.9642 percent = fportfolio), the banking organization would not be able to
recognize the risk-mitigating benefits of the collateral received.
Instead, the banking organization would be required to separately risk-weight the on-
balance sheet and off-balance sheet portion of each individual transaction. In this example,
assuming that both individual transactions are treated as secured borrowings instead of sales
under GAAP, the first transaction in which a banking organization lends $100 in cash to an
unregulated financial institution and receives $101 in investment grade corporate bonds would
Page 132 of 1089
result in an on-balance sheet receivable of $100.126 If the second transaction is a securities
lending transaction from the perspective of the banking organization and the banking
organization is permitted to sell or repledge the equity securities, the transaction results in an
increase in the banking organization's balance sheet of $102 for the equity securities received
from the counterparty. The banking organization would be required to apply a 100 percent credit
conversion factor (CCF) to the off-balance sheet exposure to its counterparty for the return of the
investment grade corporate bonds. In this case, the off-balance sheet exposure to the
counterparty would be the $100 of lent investment grade corporate bonds.¹27 The total exposure
amount for the two transactions would be ($100 receivable + $102 equity exposure + $100 off-
balance sheet exposure) = $302. If the banking organization is not permitted to sell or repledge
the equity securities in the second transaction, or if that transaction is a securities borrowing
transaction from the perspective of the banking organization, the equity securities received by the
banking organization would not be recognized on the banking organization's balance sheet. ¹28
The banking organization would still be required to apply a 100 percent CCF to the off-balance
sheet exposure to its counterparty, so the total exposure amount would be ($100 receivable +
$100 off-balance sheet exposure) = $200.¹³
129
130
126 The transaction would also result in credit (reduction) of $100 cash, but this would have no
impact on the banking organization's risk-weighted assets as cash is assigned a 0 percent risk
weight under section ____.111.
127
See proposed section ____.112(b)(5)(iv).
128 If the transaction is a securities borrowing transaction from the perspective of the banking
organization, and if the equity securities received are sold or if the counterparty defaults, the
banking organization would be required to record an obligation to return the securities.
129 See proposed section_.112(b)(5)(v)
130
In all cases, the $100 of investment grade corporate bonds the banking organization has lent
would continue to remain on the banking organization's balance sheet and the banking
organization would continue to maintain risk-based capital against these bonds.

Question 58: What alternative minimum haircut floors should the agencies consider and
why? What would be the advantages and disadvantages of setting the minimum haircuts at a
higher level, such as at the proposed market price volatility haircuts used for recognition of
collateral for eligible margin loans and repo-style transactions, or at levels between the
proposed minimum haircut floors and the proposed market price volatility haircuts?
Question 59: Where a banking organization has exchanged multiple securities for
multiple other securities under a QMNA with an unregulated financial institution, what would be
the costs and benefits of providing banking organizations the flexibility to apply a single-
transaction haircut floor on a transaction-by-transaction basis for in-scope transactions within
the netting set, rather than applying a portfolio-based floor? Under this approach, each in-scope
transaction within a netting set would be evaluated separately. Banking organizations would be
permitted to recognize the risk-mitigation benefits of collateral for individual transactions that
meet the single-transaction haircut floor, even if the netting set did not meet the portfolio-based
floor.
Question 60: How can the proposed formulas used for determining whether an in-scope
transaction or in-scope set of transactions breaches the minimum haircut floors be improved or
further clarified?
Question 61: What are the advantages and disadvantages of the proposed approach to
minimum collateral haircuts for in-scope transactions with unregulated financial institutions?
How might the proposal change the behavior of banking organizations and their counterparties,
including changes in funding practices and potential migration of funding transactions to other
counterparties? Commenters are encouraged to provide data and supporting analysis.
D. Securitization framework
Page 134 of 1089
The securitization framework is designed to provide the capital requirement for
exposures that involve the tranching of credit risk of one or more underlying financial exposures.
The risk and complexity posed by securitizations differ relative to direct exposure to the
underlying assets in the securitization because the credit risk of those assets is divided into
different levels of loss prioritization using a wide range of structural mechanisms.131 The
performance of a securitization depends not only on the structure, but also on the performance of
the underlying assets and certain parties to the securitization structure, including the asset
servicer and any liquidity facility provider. The involvement of these parties makes securitization
exposures susceptible to additional risks as compared to direct credit exposures.
The proposed securitization framework would draw on many features of the framework
in subpart E of the current capital rule with the following modifications: (1) additional
operational requirements for synthetic securitizations; (2) a modified treatment for
resecuritizations that meet the operational requirements; (3) a new securitization standardized
approach (SEC-SA), as a replacement to the supervisory formula approach and standardized
supervisory formula approach (SSFA), which includes, relative to the SSFA, modified
definitions of attachment point and detachment point, a modified definition of the W parameter,
modifications to the definition of KG, a higher p-factor, a lower risk-weight floor for
securitization exposures that are not resecuritization exposures, and a higher risk-weight floor for
resecuritization exposures; (4) a prohibition on using the securitization framework for nth-to-
131 To segment a reference portfolio into different levels of risks for different investors, the
securitization process divides the reference portfolio into different slices, called tranches, which
receive cash flows or absorb losses based on a predetermined order of priority. This payment
structure is known as the "cash flow waterfall," or simply the "waterfall." The waterfall schedule
prioritizes the manner in which interest or principal payments from the reference portfolio must
be allocated, creating different risk-return profiles for each tranche.
Page 135 of 1089
default credit derivatives; (5) a new treatment for derivative contracts that do not provide credit
enhancement; (6) a modified treatment for overlapping exposures; (7) new maximum capital
requirements and eligibility criteria for certain senior securitization exposures (the "look-through
approach"); (8) a modification to the treatment for credit-enhancing interest only strips (CEIOs);
and (9) a new framework for non-performing loan (NPL) securitizations. ¹
132
1. Operational requirements
The proposed operational requirements would be consistent with the operational
requirements in subpart E of the current capital rule, with three exceptions as described below. In
addition, for resecuritization exposures that meet the operational requirements, the proposal
would eliminate the option for banking organizations to treat the exposures as if they had not
been securitized.
a. Early amortization provisions
Early amortization provisions cause investors in securitization exposures to be repaid
before the original stated maturity when certain conditions are triggered. For example, many
securitizations of revolving credit facilities, most commonly credit-card receivable
securitizations, contain provisions that require the securitization to be wound down and investors
repaid on an accelerated basis if excess spread falls below a certain threshold. This decrease in
excess spread would typically be caused by credit deterioration in the underlying exposures.
Such provisions can expose the originating banking organization to increased credit and liquidity
risk and potentially increased capital requirements after the early amortization is triggered as the
banking organization could be obligated to fund the borrowers' future draws on the revolving
132 The proposal generally would use the same approaches to determine the exposure amount of
securitization exposures.
Page 136 of 1089
lines of credit. In such an instance, the originating banking organization may have to either find a
new funding source, whether internal or external, to cover the new draws or reduce borrowers'
credit line availability.
The proposal would expand the applicability of the operational requirements regarding
early amortization provisions to synthetic securitizations, similar to their application to
traditional securitizations under subpart D of the current capital rule. Under §___. 2 of the current
capital rule, an early amortization provision means a provision in the documentation governing a
securitization that, when triggered, causes investors in the securitization exposure to be repaid
before the original stated maturity of the securitization exposure, with certain exceptions.
Under the proposal, if a synthetic securitization includes an early amortization provision and
references one or more underlying exposures in which the borrower is permitted to vary the
drawn amount within an agreed limit under a line of credit, the banking organization would be
required to hold risk-based capital against the underlying exposures as if they had not been
synthetically securitized.
Question 62: What, if any, additional exceptions to the early amortization provision
definition should the agencies consider and why, provided such exceptions would not incentivize
a banking organization to provide implicit support to a securitization exposure?
b. Synthetic excess spread
133
133
The exceptions to the current definition of early amortization provision are a provision that:
(1) is triggered solely by events not directly related to the performance of the underlying
exposures or the originating banking organization (such as material changes in tax laws or
regulations); or (2) leaves investors fully exposed to future draws by borrowers on the underlying
exposures even after the provision is triggered.
Page 137 of 1089
The proposal would prohibit an originating banking organization from recognizing the
risk-mitigating benefits of a synthetic securitization that includes synthetic excess spread.
Synthetic excess spread would be defined in the proposal as any contractual provision in a
synthetic securitization that is designed to absorb losses prior to any of the tranches of the
securitization structure. Synthetic excess spread is a form of credit enhancement provided by the
originating banking organization to the investors in the synthetic securitization; therefore, the
originating banking organization should maintain capital against the credit exposure represented
by the synthetic excess spread. However, a risk-based capital requirement for synthetic excess
spread may not be determinable with sufficient precision to promote comparability across
banking organizations because the amount of synthetic excess spread made available to investors
in the synthetic securitization would depend upon the maturity of the underlying assets, which
itself depends on whether any of the underlying exposures have defaulted or prepaid. In
particular, the total amount of synthetic excess spread made available at inception to investors
over the life of the transaction may not be known ex ante, as the outstanding balance of the
securitization in future years is unknown. Therefore, if a synthetic securitization structure
includes synthetic excess spread, the banking organization would be required under the proposal
to maintain capital against all the underlying exposures as if they had not been synthetically
securitized.
Question 63: What clarifications or modifications should the agencies consider for the
above proposed definition of synthetic excess spread and why?
Question 64: What are the advantages and disadvantages of the proposed treatment of
synthetic securitizations with synthetic excess spread? If the agencies were to permit originating
banking organizations to recognize the credit risk-mitigation benefits of securitizations with
Page 138 of 1089
synthetic excess spread, how should the exposure amount of the synthetic excess spread be
calculated, and what would be the appropriate capital requirement for synthetic excess spread?
c. Minimum payment threshold
Under the proposal, the operational requirements for synthetic securitizations would
include a new requirement that any applicable minimum payment threshold for the credit risk
mitigant be consistent with standard market practice. A minimum payment threshold is a
contractual minimum amount that must be delinquent before a credit event is deemed to have
occurred. The proposed minimum payment threshold criterion is intended to prohibit an
originating banking organization from recognizing the capital reducing benefits of a synthetic
securitization whose minimum payment threshold is so large that it allows for material losses to
occur without triggering the credit protection acquired by the protection purchaser, as such
provisions would interfere with an effective transfer of credit risk.
Question 65: What are the benefits and drawbacks of the proposed minimum payment
threshold criterion? What, if any, additional criteria or clarifications should the agencies
consider and why?
d. Resecuritization exposures
For a resecuritization that is a traditional securitization, if the operational requirements
have been met, an originating banking organization would be required to exclude the transferred
exposures from the calculation of its risk-weighted assets and maintain risk-based capital against
any credit risk it retains in connection with the resecuritization. Unlike in the case of a
securitization exposure that is not a resecuritization, the proposal would not allow a banking
organization the option to elect to treat a resecuritization as if the underlying exposures had not
been re-securitized. While a securitization of non-securitized assets can be used to diversify or
Page 139 of 1089
transfer credit risk of those exposures, a resecuritization might not offer similar risk reduction or
diversification benefits, particularly if the underlying exposures reflect similar high-risk tranches
of other securitizations. Therefore, these resecuritization exposures warrant a higher regulatory
capital requirement than that applicable to the underlying exposures.
Similarly, for a resecuritization that is a synthetic securitization, if the operational
requirements have been met, an originating banking organization would be required to recognize
for risk-based capital purposes the use of a credit risk mitigant to hedge the underlying exposures
and must hold capital against any credit risk of the exposures it retains in connection with the
synthetic securitization.
2. Securitization standardized approach (SEC-SA)
Under the proposal, a banking organization would determine the capital requirements for
most securitization exposures under the SEC-SA, which is substantively similar to the SSFA in
the current capital rule except for certain changes as discussed below. Under the SEC-SA, a
banking organization would determine the risk weight for a securitization exposure based on the
risk weight of the underlying assets, with adjustments to reflect (1) delinquencies in such assets,
(2) the securitization exposure's subordination level in the allocation of losses, and (3) the
heightened correlation and additional risks inherent in securitizations relative to direct credit
exposures.
To calculate the risk weight for a securitization exposure using the SEC-SA, a banking
organization must have accurate information on the parameters used in the SEC-SA calculation.
If the banking organization cannot, or chooses not to, apply the SEC-SA, the banking
organization would be required to apply a 1,250 percent risk weight to the exposure.
a. Definition of attachment point and detachment point
Page 140 of 1089
Under the current capital rule, the attachment point (parameter A) of a securitization
exposure equals the ratio of the current dollar amount of underlying exposures that are
subordinated to the exposure of the banking organization to the current dollar amount of
underlying exposures. Any reserve account funded by the accumulated cash flows from the
underlying exposures that is subordinated to the banking organization's securitization exposure
may be included in the calculation of parameter A to the extent that cash is present in the
account. The calculation in the current capital rule does not permit a banking organization to
recognize noncash assets in a reserve account in the calculation of parameter A. In contrast, the
proposal would permit a banking organization to recognize all assets, cash or noncash, that are
included in a reserve account in the calculation of parameter A. However, a banking organization
would not be allowed to include interest rate derivative contracts and exchange rate derivative
contracts, or the cash collateral accounts related to these instruments, in the calculation of
parameters A and D. The agencies are proposing this treatment because assets held in a funded
reserve account, whether cash or noncash, can provide credit enhancement to a securitization
exposure, whereas interest rate and foreign exchange derivatives (and any cash collateral held
against these derivatives) do not.
134
The proposal would modify the definition of attachment point so that it refers to the
outstanding balance of the underlying assets in the pool rather than the current dollar value of the
underlying exposures. By referencing the outstanding balance of the underlying assets instead of
the current dollar amount of the underlying exposures, the revised definition would clarify that a
134 For example, if a securitization SPE has assets denominated in U.S. Dollars and liabilities
denominated in Euros, and if the securitization SPE executes a USD-EUR foreign exchange
swap, the swap hedges the foreign exchange risk between the SPE's assets and liabilities but
does not provide credit enhancement to any of the tranches of the securitization.
Page 141 of 1089
banking organization may recognize a nonrefundable purchase price discount ¹35 when
calculating the attachment point of a securitization exposure. A similar modification would be
made to the definition of detachment point. 136
b. Definition of W parameter
Under the current capital rule, parameter W, which is expressed as a decimal value
between zero and one, reflects the proportion of underlying exposures that are not performing or
are delinquent, according to criteria outlined in the rule. The proposal would apply a similar
definition of parameter W for subpart E, but clarify that for resecuritization exposures, any
underlying exposure that is a securitization exposure would only be included in the denominator
of the ratio and would be excluded from the numerator of the ratio. That is, for resecuritization
exposures, parameter W would be the ratio of the sum of the outstanding balance of any
underlying exposures of the securitization that meet any of the criteria in paragraphs
___.133(b)(1)(i) through (vi) of the proposal that are not securitization exposures to the
outstanding balance of all underlying exposures. Underlying securitization exposures need not be
included in the numerator of parameter W because the risk weight of the underlying
securitization exposure as calculated by the SEC-SA already reflects the impact of any
135
The proposal would define nonrefundable purchase price discount to mean the difference
between the initial outstanding balance of the exposures in the underlying pool and the price at
which these exposures are sold by the originator to the securitization SPE, when neither
originator nor the original lender are reimbursed for this difference. In cases where the originator
underwrites tranches of a NPL securitization for subsequent sale, the NRPPD may include the
differences between the notional amount of the tranches and the price at which these tranches are
first sold to unrelated third parties. For any given piece of a securitization tranche, only its initial
sale from the originator to investors is taken into account in the determination of NRPPD. The
purchase prices of subsequent re-sales are not considered. See proposed definition in section
__.101.
136
For the sake of consistency, the proposal would also use the term “outstanding balance" in the
calculation of W and KG.
Page 142 of 1089
delinquent or otherwise nonperforming loans within the underlying securitization exposure. For
example, if a resecuritization with a notional amount of $10 million includes underlying
securitization exposures with a notional amount of $5 million and underlying non-securitization
exposures with a notional amount of $5 million, and if $500,000 of the non-securitization
exposures are delinquent, the numerator for the W parameter would be $500,000 while the
denominator for the W parameter would be $10 million. This would be true regardless of the
delinquency status of any of the securitization exposures.
c. Delinquency-adjusted (KA) and non-adjusted (KG) weighted-average capital requirement
of the underlying exposures
Under the proposal, KĄ would reflect the delinquency-adjusted, weighted-average capital
requirement of the underlying exposures and would be a function of KG and W. Under this
approach, in order to calculate parameter W, and thus KÃ, the banking organization must know
the delinquency status of all underlying exposures in the securitization. KG would equal the
weighted average total capital requirement of the underlying exposures (with the outstanding
balance used as the weight for each exposure), calculated using the risk weights according to
subpart E of the proposed rule.
The agencies are proposing two modifications to the definition of KG for SEC-SA
compared to the current KG as used in the SSFA. First, for interest rate derivative contracts and
exchange rate derivative contracts, the positive current exposure times the risk weight of the
counterparty multiplied by 0.08 would be included in the numerator of KG but excluded from the
denominator of KĠ. If amounts related to interest rate and exchange rate derivative contracts
were included in both the numerator and denominator of KG, these contracts could reduce the
capital requirement of securitization exposures even though interest rate and exchange rate
Page 143 of 1089
derivative contracts do not provide any credit enhancement to a securitization. Second, if a
banking organization transfers credit risk via a synthetic securitization to a securitization SPE
and if the securitization SPE issues funded obligations to investors, the banking organization
would include the total capital requirement (exposure amount multiplied by risk weight
multiplied by 0.08) of any collateral held by the securitization SPE in the numerator of KG. The
denominator of KG is calculated without recognition of the collateral. This ensures that if
collateral held at the SPE is invested in credit-sensitive assets, the credit risk associated with
those assets will be included in the banking organization's capital calculation. Consistent with
subpart D of the current capital rule, under the proposal, the value of KG for a resecuritization
exposure would equal the weighted average of two distinct KĠ values, one for the underlying
securitization (which equals the capital requirement calculated using the SEC-SA), the other for
the underlying exposures (which equals the weighted average capital requirement of the
underlying exposures).
Question 66: Recognizing that banking organizations may not always know the
delinquency status of all underlying exposures, what would be the benefits and drawbacks of
allowing a banking organization to use the SEC-SA if the banking organization knows the
delinquency status for most, but not all, of the underlying exposures? For example, if the banking
organization knew the delinquency status of 95 percent of the exposures, it could (1) split the
underlying exposures into two subpools, (2) calculate a weighted average of the KA of the
subpool comprising the underlying exposures for which the delinquency status is known, (3)
A
assign a value of 1 for Kå of the other subpool comprising exposures for which the delinquency
status is unknown, and (4) assign a K₁ for the entire pool equal to the weighted average of the
KA for each subpool. What other approaches should the agencies consider and why?
Page 144 of 1089
d. Supervisory calibration parameter (Supervisory parameter p)
Under the proposal, a banking organization would apply a supervisory parameter p of 1.0
to securitization exposures that are not resecuritization exposures and a supervisory parameter p
of 1.5 to resecuritization exposures. The proposed increase to the supervisory parameter p for
securitizations that are not resecuritization exposures from 0.5 to 1.0 would help to ensure that
the framework produces appropriately conservative risk-based capital requirements when
combined with the reduced risk weights applicable to certain underlying assets under the
proposal that would be reflected in lower values of KG and the proposed reduction in the risk-
weight floor under SEC-SA for securitization exposures that are not resecuritization
exposures. 137
e. Supervisory risk-weight floors
The SEC-SA would require banking organizations to apply a risk weight floor to all
securitization exposures. The SEC-SA is based on assumptions and the risk weight floor ensures
a minimum level of capital is held to account for modelling risks and correlation risks. 138 The
proposal would apply a risk weight floor of 15 percent for securitization exposures that are not
resecuritization exposures. The 15 percent risk weight floor is most relevant for more senior
securitization exposures. While junior tranches can absorb a significant amount of credit risk,
senior tranches are still exposed to some amount of credit risk on the underlying exposures.
Therefore, a minimum prudential capital requirement continues to be appropriate in the
securitization context.
137 See sections III.C.2 and III.D.2.d of this Supplementary Information for a more detailed
discussion of the reduced risk weights applicable to certain underlying assets and the risk-weight
floor, respectively.
138 Default correlation is the likelihood that two or more exposures will default at the same time.
Page 145 of 1089
For resecuritization exposures, the proposed SEC-SA approach would require banking
organizations to apply a risk-weight floor of at least 100 percent. The proposed 100 percent
supervisory risk-weight floor for resecuritization exposures is intended to capture the greater
complexity of such exposures and heightened correlation risks inherent in the underlying
securitization exposures. 139
The proposal would also apply a minimum risk weight of 100 percent to NPL
securitization exposures. Compared to other securitizations, the performance of NPL
securitizations depends more heavily on the servicer's ability to generate cashflows from the
workout of the underlying exposures, typically through renegotiation of the defaulted loans with
the borrower or enforcement against the collateral. These idiosyncratic risks associated with NPL
securitizations merit a higher minimum risk weight.
3. Exceptions to the SEC-SA risk-based capital treatment for securitization
exposures
Securitization exposures sometimes contain unique features that, if not accounted for,
could produce inconsistent outcomes under the SEC-SA or in some cases make the calculation of
the risk weight inoperable. Thus, notwithstanding the general application of SEC-SA, the
proposal would include additional approaches to account for certain types of securitization
139
In a typical securitization exposure that is not a resecuritization, each underlying exposure is
subject to idiosyncratic default risks (for example, the employment status of each obligor) which
may exhibit lower relative default correlation. In a resecuritization exposure, the underlying
exposures, which are typically tranches of securitizations, usually have credit enhancement from
more junior tranches that protects against many idiosyncratic risks. Systematic risks are more
likely to generate defaults in the underlying exposures of resecuritizations than idiosyncratic
risks, but systematic risks are also much more correlated; therefore, resecuritizations typically
have higher default correlations than other types of securitizations.
Page 146 of 1089
exposures, which would more appropriately align the capital requirement with the risk of the
exposure.
a. Nth-to-default credit derivatives
Under the current capital rule, a banking organization that has purchased credit protection
in the form of an nth-to-default credit derivative is permitted to recognize the risk mitigating
benefits of that derivative. The proposal would not permit banking organizations to recognize
any risk-mitigating benefit for nth-to-default credit derivatives in which the banking organization
is the protection purchaser under either the proposed credit risk mitigation framework or under
the proposed securitization framework. Purchased credit protection through nth-to-default
derivatives often does not correlate with the hedged exposure which inhibits the risk mitigating
benefits of the instrument.
For nth-to-default credit derivatives in which the banking organization is the protection
provider, the proposal would prohibit use of the securitization framework and instead would
require banking organizations to calculate the risk-weighted asset amount by multiplying the
aggregate risk weights of the assets included in the basket up to a maximum of 1,250 percent by
the notional amount of the protection provided by the credit derivative. In aggregating the risk
weights, the (n-1) assets with the lowest risk weight may be excluded from the calculation. This
approach would require banking organizations to maintain capital based on the risk
characteristics of all the underlying assets in the basket on which it is providing protection, while
accounting for the fact that the banking organization is not required to make a payment unless
"n" names in the basket default.
b. Derivative contracts that do not provide credit enhancements
Page 147 of 1089
The proposal would provide a new treatment for certain interest rate or foreign exchange
derivative contracts that qualify as securitization exposures. Some securitizations either make
payments to investors in a different currency from the underlying exposures or make fixed
payments to investors when the cash flows received on the securitized assets are linked to a
floating interest rate. To neutralize these foreign exchange or interest rate risks, the securitization
SPE may enter into a derivative contract that mirrors the currency or interest rate mismatch
between the exposures and the tranches. Cash flows required to be made to the derivative
counterparty tend to have a senior claim to the principal and interest payment of the collateral,
and therefore tend not to provide credit enhancement.
The proposal would require a banking organization that acts as a counterparty to these
types of interest rate and foreign exchange derivatives to set the risk weight on such derivatives
equal to the risk weight calculated under the SEC-SA for a securitization exposure that is pari
passu to the derivative contract or, if such an exposure does not exist, the risk weight of the next
subordinated tranche of the securitization exposure. A banking organization may otherwise not
be able to calculate a risk weight for these derivative contracts using the SEC-SA because the
attachment and detachment points under the proposed formula could equal one another,
rendering the formula inoperable. The proposed treatment is intended to appropriately reflect
how the credit risk associated with these derivative contracts would be commensurate with or
less than the credit risk associated with a pari passu tranche or the next subordinated tranche of a
securitization exposure.
The current capital rule permits banking organizations to assign a risk-weighted asset
amount for certain derivative contracts that are securitization exposures equal to the exposure
amount of the derivative contract (i.e., a risk weight of 100 percent). The proposal would
Page 148 of 1089
eliminate this option. The approaches for derivative contracts described in sections III.C.4. of
this Supplementary Information (including the treatment for derivative contracts that do not
provide credit enhancement described above) are more risk-sensitive and reflective of the risks
than a flat 100 percent risk weight.
i. Overlapping exposures
The proposal would introduce new provisions for overlapping exposures. ¹4⁰ First, the
proposal would allow a banking organization to treat two non-overlapping securitization
exposures as overlapping to the degree that the banking organization assumes that obligations
with respect to one of the exposures covers obligations with respect to the other exposure. For
example, if a banking organization provides a full liquidity facility to an ABCP program that is
not contractually required to fund defaulted assets and the banking organization also holds
commercial paper issued by the ABCP program, a banking organization would be permitted to
calculate risk-weighted assets only for the liquidity facility if the banking organization assumes,
for purposes of calculating risk-based capital requirements, that the liquidity facility would be
required to fund the defaulted assets. In this case, the banking organization would be maintaining
capital to cover losses on the commercial paper when calculating capital requirements for the
liquidity facility, so there is no need to assign a separate capital requirement for the commercial
paper held by the banking organization.
Second, the proposal would also allow a banking organization to recognize an overlap
between relevant risk-based requirements for securitization exposures under subpart E and
market risk covered positions under subpart F, provided the banking organization is able to
140
An overlapping exposure occurs when a banking organization is exposed to the same risk to
the same obligor through multiple direct or indirect exposures to that obligor.
Page 149 of 1089
calculate and compare the capital requirements for the relevant exposures. For example, a
banking organization could hold a correlation trading position that would be subject to the
proposed requirements under subpart F but would preclude losses in all circumstances on a
separate securitization exposure held by the banking organization that would be subject to
requirements under subpart E under the proposal. In such cases, the proposal would allow the
banking organization to calculate the risk-based requirement for the overlapping portion of the
exposures based on the greater of the requirement under subpart E or under subpart F.
Question 67: What challenges, if any, would the option to recognize an overlap between
market risk covered and noncovered positions introduce? To what degree do banking
organizations anticipate recognizing overlaps between market risk covered and noncovered
positions?
Look-through approach for senior securitization exposures
The proposal would introduce a provision that would allow a banking organization to cap
the risk weight applied to a senior securitization exposure that is not a resecuritization exposure
at the weighted-average risk weight of the underlying exposures, provided that the banking
organization has knowledge of the composition of all of the underlying exposures (also referred
to as the “look-through approach"). For purposes of calculating the weighted-average risk
weight, the unpaid principal balance would be used as the weight for each exposure. The
proposal would define a senior securitization exposure as an exposure that has a first priority
claim on the cash flows from the underlying exposures. When determining whether a
securitization exposure has a first priority claim on the cash flows from the underlying
exposures, a banking organization would not be required to consider amounts due under interest
rate derivative contracts, exchange rate derivative contracts, and servicer cash advance facility
ii.
Page 150 of 1089
contracts, 141
or any fees and other similar payments to be made by the securitization SPE to other
parties. Both the most senior commercial paper issued by an ABCP program and a liquidity
facility that supports the ABCP program may be senior securitization exposures if the liquidity
facility provider's right to reimbursement of the drawn amounts is senior to all claims on the
cash flows from the underlying exposures, except amounts due under interest rate derivative
contracts, exchange rate derivative contracts, and servicer cash advance facility contracts, fees
due, and other similar payments.
Accordingly, under the proposed look-through approach, if a senior securitization
exposure's underlying pool of assets consists solely of loans with a weighted average risk weight
of 100 percent, the risk weight for the senior securitization exposure would be the lower of the
risk weight calculated under the SEC-SA and 100 percent. The proposed risk-weight cap is
intended to recognize that the credit risk associated with each dollar of a senior securitization
exposure generally will not be greater than the credit risk associated with each dollar of the
underlying assets, because the non-senior tranches of a securitization provide credit enhancement
to the senior tranche.
Notwithstanding the proposed risk weight cap, the proposal would require banking
organizations to floor the total risk-based capital requirement under the look-through approach at
15 percent, consistent with the proposed 15 percent floor under the SEC-SA. The proposed 15
percent floor, even if it results in a risk weight amount greater than the risk weight cap, is
intended to appropriately reflect the minimum amount of risk-based capital that a banking
141
A servicer cash advance facility means a facility under which the servicer of the underlying
exposures of a securitization may advance cash to ensure an uninterrupted flow of payments to
investors in the securitization, including advances made to cover foreclosure costs or other
expenses to facilitate the timely collection of the underlying exposures.
Page 151 of 1089
organization should maintain for such exposures given that the process of securitization can
introduce additional risks that are not present in the underlying exposures such as modelling risks
and correlation risks.
Credit-enhancing interest only strips
The proposal would require a banking organization to deduct from common equity tier 1
capital any portion of a CEIO strip¹42 that does not constitute an after-tax-gain-on sale, regardless
of whether the securitization exposure meets the proposed operational requirements. The
proposed treatment for CEIOS would be different than under subpart D of the current capital rule,
which requires a risk weight of 1,250 percent for these items. The agencies are proposing to
require deduction from common equity tier 1 capital because valuations of CEIOs can include a
high degree of subjectivity and, just like assets subject to deduction under the current capital rule
such as goodwill and other intangible assets, banking organizations may not be able to fully
realize value from CEIOS based on their balance sheet carrying amounts. While a deduction is
generally equivalent to a 1,250 percent risk weight when the banking organization maintains an 8
percent capital ratio, given the various capital ratios, buffers, and add-ons applicable to banking
organizations subject to subpart E, applying a deduction provides a more consistent treatment
across ratios and banking organizations.
iv. NPL securitizations
111.
The proposal would define an NPL securitization as a securitization whose underlying
exposures consist solely of loans where parameter W for the underlying pool is greater than or
142
See §.2 for the definition of credit-enhancing interest-only strip.
Page 152 of 1089
equal to 90 percent at the origination cut-off date ¹43 and at any subsequent date on which assets
are added to or removed from the pool due to replenishment or restructuring. A securitization
exposure that meets the definition of a resecuritization exposure would be excluded from the
definition of an NPL securitization.
In a typical NPL securitization, the originating banking organization sells the non-
performing loans to a securitization SPE at a significant discount to the outstanding loan
balances (reflecting the nonperforming nature of the underlying exposures) and this discount acts
as a credit enhancement to investors. Unlike the performance of securitizations of performing
loans, which principally depend on the cash flows of the underlying loans, the performance of
NPL securitizations depends in part on the performance of workouts on defaulted loans, which
are uncertain and could be volatile, and on the liquidation of underlying collateral for those loans
which are unable to be cured.
The proposal would introduce a specific approach for NPL securitization exposures as the
proposed SEC-SA may be inappropriate for the unique risks of such exposures. The proposal
would require a banking organization to assign a risk weight of 100 percent to a securitization
exposure to an NPL securitization if the following conditions are satisfied: (1) the transaction
structure meets the definition of a traditional securitization; (2) the securitization has a credit
enhancement in the form of a nonrefundable purchase price discount greater than or equal to 50
percent of the outstanding balance of the pool of exposures; and (3) the banking organization's
exposure is a senior securitization exposure as described in section III.D.3.b.ii. of this
143 Cut-off date is the date on which the composition of the asset pool collateralizing a
securitization transaction is established. This means that all assets to be included in a
securitization must already be in existence and meet the NPL criteria as of that date.
Page 153 of 1089
Supplementary Information. ¹44 Using the SEC-SA for senior securitizations of NPLs that meet
these criteria would result in capital requirements that do not reflect the nonrefundable purchase
price discount associated with these transactions. The SEC-SA is calibrated on the basis that the
loans in the pool at origination are generally performing and is therefore inappropriate for senior
exposures to securitizations of NPLs that meet these criteria.
If the NPL securitization exposure is not a senior securitization exposure or the purchase
price discount is less than 50 percent, the banking organization would be required to use the
SEC-SA to calculate the risk weight (subject to a risk weight floor of 100 percent and reflecting
all delinquent exposures in calculating parameter W). If the exposure does not meet the
requirements of the SEC-SA, the banking organization must assign a risk weight of 1,250 to the
exposure.
I. Attachment and detachment points for NPL securitizations
Under the proposal, the nonrefundable purchase price discount would equal the
difference between the outstanding balance of the underlying exposures and the price at which
these exposures are sold by the originator ¹45 to investors on a final basis without recourse
through the securitization SPE, when neither the originator nor the original lender are eligible for
future reimbursement for this difference (that is, that the purchase price discount is “non-
refundable"). In cases where the originator underwrites tranches of the NPL securitization for
subsequent sale, a banking organization may include in the calculation of the nonrefundable
144
If the banking organization is an originating banking organization with respect to the NPL
securitization, the banking organization may maintain risk-based capital against the transferred
exposures as if they had not been securitized and must deduct from common equity tier 1 capital
any after-tax gain-on-sale resulting from the transaction and any portion of a CEIO strip that
does not constitute an after-tax gain-on-sale.
145 While originator typically refers to the party originating the underlying loans, in the NPL
context it refers to the party arranging the NPL securitization (i.e., the securitizer).
Page 154 of 1089
purchase price discount the differences between the outstanding balance of the underlying
nonperforming loans and the price at which the tranches are first sold to third parties unrelated to
the originator. For any given piece of a securitization tranche, a banking organization may only
take into account the initial sale from the originator to investors in the determination of the
nonrefundable purchase price discount and may not account for any subsequent secondary re-
sales.
Since the calculation of parameters A and D both depend on the outstanding balance of
the assets in the underlying pool, any nonrefundable purchase price discount associated with a
securitization would be included in both the numerator and denominator of parameters A and D.
For example, assume an originating banking organization transfers a pool of mortgage loans with
an outstanding balance of $100 million to a securitization SPE at a price of $60 million. The
nonrefundable purchase price discount would be the difference between the unpaid principal
balances on the underlying mortgages at the time of sale to the securitization SPE and the price
at which the originating banking organization sold these mortgages to the securitization SPE
(that is, $40 million). Assume that the securitization SPE issues $60 million in securitization
tranches of which the banking organization retains the senior $50 million tranche and an
investing banking organization purchases the $10 million first-loss tranche. Parameter A for the
investing banking organization's exposure would equal 40 percent (that is, the ratio of $40
million to $100 million). Thus, the discount paid for the underlying assets is effectively the "first
loss" position in the securitization. Likewise, the originating banking organization would treat
both the nonrefundable purchase price discount and the investing banking organization's tranche
as subordinate and would set Parameter A at 50 percent.
Page 155 of 1089
If, in the example above, the originating bank sells both tranches and each tranche is sold
at a 20 percent discount (that is, the $10 million first loss tranche is sold for a price of $8 million
and the $50 million senior tranche is sold for a price of $40 million), the investing banking
organization that purchases the first-loss tranche would be permitted to assign an attachment
point of 52 percent to its exposure, because the nonrefundable purchase price discount would be
the difference between the original outstanding amount of the exposures ($100 million) and the
total notional value of all the securitization tranches ($48 million). The investing banking
organization that purchases the senior tranche would be permitted to assign an attachment point
of 60 percent to the exposure.
4. Credit risk mitigation for securitization exposures
The proposal would replace the existing credit risk mitigation framework under subpart E
with a framework that is consistent with the credit risk mitigation framework under subpart D of
the current capital rule,¹46 with one exception. A banking organization that purchases or sells
tranched credit protection, whether hedged or unhedged, referencing part of a senior tranche
would not be allowed to treat the lower-priority portion that the credit protection does not
reference as a senior securitization exposure. For example, if a banking organization holds a
securitization exposure with an attachment point of 20 percent and a detachment point of 100
percent and the banking organization purchases an eligible guarantee with an attachment point of
50 percent and a detachment point of 100 percent, the banking organization's residual exposure,
which attaches at 20 percent and detaches at 50 percent, would be considered a non-senior
146
In particular, the proposal would eliminate references to model-based approaches that are
currently contained in subpart E. The proposal would also eliminate the formula for collateral
recognition under subpart E, which includes standard supervisory haircuts calibrated to a 65-day
holding period and permits banking organizations to calculate their own estimates of haircuts
with prior supervisory approval.
Page 156 of 1089
securitization exposure, and the banking organization would not be permitted to apply the look-
through approach to this exposure. A banking organization that purchases a mezzanine tranche
that attaches at 20 percent and detaches at 50 percent has a similar economic exposure to a
banking organization that purchases a senior tranche that attaches at 20 percent and detaches at
100 percent and then purchases credit protection that attaches at 50 percent and detaches at 100
percent. Since the former transaction would not be considered a senior securitization exposure
eligible for the look-through approach, the agencies believe that the latter transaction likewise
should not be eligible for the look-through approach. Alternatively, the banking organization
may choose not to recognize the tranched credit protection, in which case, the banking
organization may treat the securitization exposure (which attaches at 20 percent and detaches at
100 percent) as a senior securitization exposure.
E. Equity Exposures
Equity exposures present a greater risk of loss relative to credit exposures as equity
exposures represent an ownership interest in the issuer of an equity instrument and have a lower
priority of payment or reimbursement in the event that the issuing entity fails to meet its credit
obligations. For example, an equity exposure entitles a banking organization to no more than the
pro-rata residual value of a company after all other creditors, including subordinated debt
holders, are repaid. As a result, consistent with the current capital rule, the proposal would
generally assign higher risk weights to equity exposures than exposures subject to the proposed
credit risk framework.
The current capital rule's advanced approaches equity framework permits use of an
internal models approach for publicly traded and non-publicly traded equity exposures and
equity derivative contracts. The proposal would not include an internal models approach because
Page 157 of 1089
of the types of equity exposures that would likely be subject to the equity framework. Under the
proposal, material publicly traded equity exposures would generally be subject to the proposed
market risk framework described in section III.H of this Supplementary Information, unless there
are restrictions on the tradability of such exposures. ¹47 Similarly, equity exposures to investment
funds for which the banking organization has access to the investment fund's prospectus,
partnership agreement, or similar contract that defines the fund's permissible investments and
investment limits, and is either able to (1) calculate a market risk capital requirement for its
proportional ownership share of each exposure held by the investment fund, or (2) obtain daily
price quotes - would generally be subject to the proposed market risk framework.¹48 As the
proposed equity framework would primarily cover illiquid or infrequently traded equity
exposures, the proposal would require banking organizations to use a standardized approach to
determine capital requirements for such equity exposures. This is intended to increase the
transparency of the capital framework and facilitate comparisons of capital adequacy across
banking organizations.
The proposed framework would largely maintain those sections of the current capital
rule's equity framework that do not rely on models, including the definition of equity
exposure, ¹49 the definition of investment fund, the treatment of stable value protection, and the
methods for measuring the exposure amount for equity exposures. The proposal would make
certain modifications to improve the risk sensitivity and robustness of the risk-based capital
While the proposal would require banking organizations that are not subject to the proposed
market risk capital framework to calculate risk-weighted assets for all publicly traded equity
exposures under the proposed equity framework, such entities typically do not have material
equity exposures.

147
Page 158 of 1089
requirements for equity exposures relative to the current capital rule. Specifically, the proposal
would: (1) eliminate the 100 percent risk weight threshold category under the simple risk-weight
approach for non-significant equity exposures; (2) eliminate the effective and ineffective hedge
pair treatment under the simple risk-weight approach; (3) align the conversion factors for
conditional commitments to acquire an equity exposure, consistent with the proposed off-balance
sheet treatment for exposures subject to the proposed credit risk framework, and (4) increase the
risk weight applicable to equity exposures to investment firms with greater than immaterial
leverage that the primary federal supervisor has determined do not qualify as a traditional
securitization. Additionally, the proposal would enhance the risk-sensitivity of the current capital
rule's look-through approaches for equity exposures to investment funds by (1) specifying a
hierarchy of approaches that a banking organization would be required to use based on the nature
and quality of the information available to the banking organization concerning the investment
fund's underlying assets and liabilities; (2) modifying the full look-through and the alternative
look-through approaches to explicitly capture off-balance sheet exposures held by an investment
fund, the counterparty credit risk and CVA risk of any underlying derivatives held by the
investment fund, and the leverage of the investment fund; (3) replacing the simple modified
look-through approach with a flat 1,250 percent risk weight, and (4) flooring the risk weight
applicable to an equity exposure to an investment fund at 20 percent, consistent with the
standardized approach in the current capital rule.
1. Risk-weighted Asset Amount
The proposal would retain the risk-weighted asset amount calculation under the current
capital rule. Consistent with the current capital rule, the proposal would require a banking
organization to determine the risk-weighted asset amount for each equity exposure, except for
Page 159 of 1089
equity exposures to investment funds, by multiplying the adjusted carrying value of the exposure
by the lowest applicable risk weight, as described below in section III.E.1.b. of this
Supplementary Information. A banking organization would determine the risk-weighted asset
amount for an equity exposure to an investment fund by multiplying the adjusted carrying value
of the exposure by either the risk weight calculated under one of the look-through approaches or
by a risk weight of 1,250 percent, as described below in section III.E.1.c. of this Supplementary
Information. A banking organization would calculate its aggregate risk-weighted asset amount
for equity exposures as the sum of the risk-weighted asset amount calculated for each equity
exposure.
150
a. Adjusted Carrying Value
Under the proposal, the adjusted carrying value of an equity exposure, including equity
exposures to investment funds, would be based on the type of exposure, as described in Table 1
below.
Table 1: Adjusted Carrying Value for Equity Exposures

150 The proposal would exclude from the proposed equity framework equity exposures that a
banking organization would be required to deduct from regulatory capital under
§_.22(d)(2)(i)(C) of the proposal. The proposal would require a banking organization to assign a
250 percent risk weight to the amount of the significant investments in the common stock of
unconsolidated financial institutions that is not deducted from common equity tier 1 capital.

the underlying equity instrument that would
evidence the same change in fair value
(measured in dollars) for a given small
change in the price of the underlying equity
instrument, minus the adjusted carrying value
of the on-balance sheet component of the
exposure.
The proposal would maintain the current capital rule's methods for calculating the
adjusted carrying value for equity exposures, with one exception. The proposal would simplify
the treatment of conditional commitments to acquire an equity exposure to remove the
differentiation of conversion factors by maturity. The proposal would require a banking
organization to multiply the effective notional principal amount of a conditional commitment by
151 Consistent with the current capital rule, the proposal would allow a banking organization to
choose not to hold risk-based capital against the counterparty credit risk of equity derivative
contracts, as long as it does so for all such contracts. Where the equity derivative contracts are
subject to a qualified master netting agreement, the proposal would require the banking
organization to either include all or exclude all of the contracts from any measure used to
determine counterparty credit risk exposure. See §__.113(d) of the proposal.
152 Consistent with the current capital rule, the proposal includes the concept of the effective
notional principal amount of the off-balance sheet portion of an equity exposure to provide a
uniform method for banking organizations to measure the on-balance sheet equivalent of an off-
balance sheet exposure. For example, if the value of a derivative contract referencing the
common stock of company X changes the same amount as the value of 150 shares of common
stock of company X, for a small change (for example, 1.0 percent) in the value of the common
stock of company X, the effective notional principal amount of the derivative contract is the
current value of 150 shares of common stock of company X, regardless of the number of shares
the derivative contract references. The adjusted carrying value of the off-balance sheet
component of the derivative is the current value of 150 shares of common stock of company X
minus the adjusted carrying value of any on-balance sheet amount associated with the derivative.
Page 161 of 1089
a 40 percent conversion factor to calculate its adjusted carrying value. The 40 percent conversion
factor is meant to appropriately account for the risk of conditional equity commitments, which
provide the banking organization more flexibility to exit the commitment relative to
unconditional equity commitments.
b. Expanded simple risk-weight approach (ESRWA)
Under the proposal, the risk-weighted asset amount for an equity exposure, except for
equity exposures to investment funds, would be the product of the adjusted carrying value of the
equity exposure multiplied by the lowest applicable risk weight in Table 2.

rule. See 12 CFR 3.2 (OCC); 12 CFR 217.2 (Board); 12 CFR 324.2 (FDIC).

An equity exposure to an investment firm that:

• Has greater than immaterial leverage.
Except for the proposed zero, 20, and 400 percent risk-weight buckets and the 250
percent risk weight for significant investments in the capital of an unconsolidated financial
institution in the form of common stock that are not deducted from regulatory capital, the
proposal would revise the risk weights applicable to other types of equity exposures relative to
those in the current capital rule's simple risk-weight approach. Specifically, to enhance risk
sensitivity and simplify the equity framework, the proposal would eliminate the following risk
weights within the current capital rule's simple risk-weight approach: (1) the 100 percent risk
weight for non-significant equity exposures whose aggregate adjusted carrying value does not
exceed 10 percent of the banking organization's total capital, and (2) the 100 and 300 percent
risk weights for the effective and ineffective portion of hedge pairs, respectively. Given the
removal of the 100 percent risk weight threshold category for non-significant equity exposures
and the revised scope of equity exposures subject to the proposed equity framework, the proposal
would (1) assign a 100 percent risk weight to equity exposures to Small Business Investment
154
Consistent with the current capital rule, the proposal would require banking organizations to
apply the 250 percent risk weight to the net long position, as calculated under section ___.22(h),
that is not deducted from capital pursuant to section ____.22(d)(2)(i)(C).
Page 163 of 1089
Companies and (2) generally assign a 250 percent risk weight to publicly traded equity exposures
with restrictions on tradability,¹
155 as described in more detail below. Finally, the proposal would
introduce a 1,250 percent risk weight to replace the 600 percent risk weight in the simple risk-
weight approach under subpart E of the current capital rule for equity exposures to investment
firms that have greater than immaterial leverage and that the primary federal supervisor has
determined do not qualify as a traditional securitization exposure, as described in more detail
below.
Removing the 100 percent risk weight for non-significant equity exposures is intended to
increase the risk sensitivity of the equity framework by requiring banking organizations to apply
a risk weight based on the characteristics of each equity exposure, rather than only for those in
excess of 10 percent of the banking organization's total capital. Given that primarily illiquid or
infrequently traded equity positions would be subject to the proposed equity framework, the
proposal would remove the 100 and 300 percent risk weights under the current capital rule for
the effective and ineffective portions of hedge pairs. The hedge pair treatment under the current
capital rule is only available if each of the equity exposures is publicly traded or has a return that
is primarily based on a publicly traded equity exposure. As such positions would generally be
subject to the proposed market risk capital framework under the proposal, the agencies are
proposing to eliminate the hedge pair treatment to simplify the risk-weighting framework under
the proposal.
155
i.
Community Development Investments and Small Business Investment
Banking organizations that would be subject to the proposed enhanced risk-based capital
framework but not the proposed market risk capital requirements would be required to assign a
250 percent risk weight to all publicly traded equity positions that are not equity exposures to
investment funds.
Page 164 of 1089
Companies
The current capital rule assigns a 100 percent risk weight to equity exposures that either
(1) qualify as a community development investment under section 24 (Eleventh) of the National
Bank Act, or (2) represent non-significant equity exposures to the extent that the aggregate
adjusted carrying value of the exposures does not exceed 10 percent of the banking
organization's total capital. Under the current capital rule, when determining which equity
exposures are "non-significant" and thus eligible for a 100 percent risk weight, a banking
organization first must include equity exposures to an unconsolidated small business investment
company or held through a consolidated small business investment company described in section
302 of the Small Business Investment Act of 1958 (15 U.S.C. 682).¹56 As depository institutions
are limited by statute to only invest up to 5 percent of total capital in the equity exposures and
debt instruments of small business investment companies, the current capital rule effectively
assigns a 100 percent risk weight to all equity exposures to such programs.
Equity exposures to community development investments and small business investment
companies generally receive favorable tax treatment and/or investment subsidies that make their
risk and return characteristics different than equity investments in general. Recognizing this
more favorable risk-return structure and the importance of these investments to promoting
important public welfare goals, the proposal would effectively retain the treatment of equity
exposures that qualify as community development investments and equity exposures to small
business investment companies under the current capital rule and assign such exposures a 100
percent risk weight.
156
See 12 CFR 3.152(b)(3)(iii)(B) (OCC); 12 CFR 217.152(b)(3)(iii)(B) (Board); 12 CFR
324.152(b)(3)(iii)(B) (FDIC).
Page 165 of 1089
ii.
Publicly traded equity with tradability restrictions¹
To appropriately capture the risk of publicly traded equity exposures with restrictions on
tradability, the proposal would (1) eliminate the 100 percent risk weight for non-significant
equity exposures up to 10 percent of total capital under the current capital rule; and (2) introduce
a 250 percent risk weight to replace the current capital rule's 300 percent risk weight applicable
to publicly traded exposures. ¹58 The revised calibration of the risk-weight for publicly traded
equity exposures with restrictions on tradability is intended to take into account the removal of
the non-significant equity exposures treatment. Under the proposal, banking organizations would
no longer assign separate risk weights (100 percent and 300 percent) to publicly traded equity
exposures based on factors that are unrelated to the underlying risk of the exposure. Instead, the
proposal would assign an identical 250 percent risk weight to all publicly traded equity
exposures with restrictions on tradability, improving the consistency and risk-sensitivity of the
framework.
157
iii.
Equity exposures to investment firms with greater than immaterial leverage and
that would meet the definition of a traditional securitization were it not for the
application of paragraph (8) of that definition
Consistent with the current capital rule, the proposed securitization framework generally
would apply to exposures to investment firms with material liabilities that are not operating
157
The proposal would require banking organizations that are not subject to the proposed market
risk capital framework to calculate risk-weighted assets for all publicly traded equity exposures
under the proposed equity framework.
158
Equity exposures, including preferred stock exposures, to the FHLBs and Farmer Mac would
continue to receive a 20 percent risk weight.

159
companies, unless the primary federal supervisor determines the exposure is not a traditional
securitization based on its leverage, risk profile or economic substance.160,161 For an equity
exposure to an investment firm that has greater than immaterial leverage and that the primary
federal supervisor has determined does not qualify as a traditional securitization exposure, the
proposal would increase the 600 percent risk weight in the simple risk-weight approach under
subpart E of the current capital rule to 1,250 percent under the proposed expanded simple risk-
weight approach. As under the current capital rule, the applicable risk weight for equity
exposures to such investment firms with greater than immaterial liabilities under the proposed
159
Operating companies generally refer to companies that are established to conduct business
with clients with the intention of earning a profit in their own right and generally produce goods
or provide services beyond the business of investing, reinvesting, holding, or trading in financial
assets. Accordingly, an equity investment in an operating company generally would be an equity
exposure under the proposal and subject to the proposed enhanced simple risk-weight approach.
Consistent with the current capital rule, under the proposal, banking organizations would be
operating companies and would not fall under the definition of a traditional securitization.
However, investment firms that generally do not produce goods or provide services beyond the
business of investing, reinvesting, holding, or trading in financial assets, would not be operating
companies, and would not qualify for the general exclusion from the definition of traditional
securitization.
160
In general, such entities qualify as "traditional securitizations" unless explicitly scoped out by
criterion (10) of that definition (for example collective investment funds, as defined in 12 CFR
208.34, as well as entities registered with the SEC under the Investment Company Act of 1940,
15 U.S.C. 80a-1, or foreign equivalents thereof). As the definition of "traditional securitization"
does not include exposures to entities where all or substantially all of the underlying exposures
are not financial exposures, equity exposures to Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) generally
would be treated in a similar manner to equity exposures to operating companies and, unless they
qualify as market risk covered positions, would be subject to the proposed expanded simple risk-
weight approach of the equity framework.
161
For example, for an equity security issued by a qualifying venture capital fund, as defined
under section__.10(c)(16) of each agency's regulations implementing section 13 of the BHC
Act, that also has outstanding debt securities, the proposal would generally require a banking
organization to treat the exposure as a traditional securitization exposure if the exposure would
meet all of the criteria of the definition of traditional securitization under section ____.2 of the
current capital rule unless the primary federal supervisor determines the exposure is not a
traditional securitization.
Page 167 of 1089
securitization framework would depend on the size of the first loss tranche. 162 For investment
firms that have greater than immaterial leverage, their capital structure may result in a large first
loss tranche that understates the risk of the exposure to the investment firm. Unlike most
traditional securitization structures, investment firms that can easily change the size and
composition of their capital structure (as well as the size and composition of their assets and off-
balance sheet exposures) may pose additional risks not covered by the securitization framework.
For example, the performance of an equity exposure to an investment firm with greater than
immaterial liabilities may depend in part on management discretion regarding asset composition
and capital structure. To appropriately capture the additional risks posed by equity exposures to
investment firms with greater than immaterial liabilities that may not be reflected within the
proposed securitization framework, the proposal would permit the primary federal supervisor to
determine that the exposure is not a traditional securitization and require the banking
organization to apply a 1,250 percent risk weight to the adjusted carrying value of equity
exposures to such investment firms. 163
Consistent with the current capital rule, under the proposal, an equity exposure to an
investment firm that is treated as a traditional securitization would be subject to due diligence
requirements. If a banking organization is unable to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the
primary federal supervisor a comprehensive understanding of the features of an equity exposure
that would materially affect the performance of the exposure, the proposal would require the
banking organization to assign a risk weight of 1,250 percent to the equity exposure to the
investment firm.
162
163 Consistent with the current capital rule, the agencies will consider the economic substance,
leverage, and risk profile of a transaction to ensure that an appropriate risk-based capital
treatment is applied. The agencies will consider a number of factors when assessing the
economic substance of a transaction including, for example, the amount of equity in the
structure, overall leverage (whether on or off-balance sheet), whether redemption rights attach to
the equity investor, and the ability of the junior tranches to absorb losses without interrupting
contractual payments to more senior tranches.

Question 68: The agencies request comment on the proposed application of a 1,250
percent risk weight to equity exposures to investment firms with greater than immaterial
leverage and that would meet the definition of a traditional securitization were it not for the
application of paragraph (8) of that definition. For what, if any, types of exposures would
requiring banking organizations to apply a 1,250 percent risk weight be inappropriate and why?
What are the advantages and disadvantages of the proposed 1,250 percent risk weight relative to
expanding the proposed look-through approaches for investment funds to include such
exposures?
Question 69: The agencies seek comment on the advantages and disadvantages of
requiring banking organizations to calculate risk-based capital requirements for equity
exposures to investment firms with greater than immaterial leverage under the proposed
securitization framework relative to the proposed look-through approaches under the equity
framework. What, if any, types of equity exposures to investment firms with greater than
immaterial leverage may not be appropriately captured by the securitization framework – such
as equity exposures to investment firms where all the exposures of the investment firm are pari
passu in the event of a bankruptcy or other insolvency proceeding? Between the proposed
securitization framework and the proposed look-through approaches under the equity
framework, which approach would be more operationally burdensome or challenging and why?
Which approach would produce a more appropriate capital requirement and why? Provide
supporting data and examples.
c. Risk Weights for Equity Exposures to Investment Funds
The separate risk-based capital treatment for equity exposures to investment funds under
the current capital rule reflects that the risk of equity exposures to investment fund structures
Page 169 of 1089
depends primarily on the nature of the underlying assets held by the fund and the degree of
leverage employed by the fund. Consistent with the current capital rule, the proposal would
require banking organizations to determine the risk weight applicable to the adjusted carrying
value of each equity exposure to an investment fund using a look-through approach in the equity
framework. When more detailed information is available about the investment fund's
characteristics, a banking organization is in a better position to evaluate the risk profile of its
equity exposure to the fund and calculate a risk weight commensurate with that risk. Conversely,
equity exposures to investment funds that provide less transparency or are not subject to regular
independent verification could present elevated risk to banking organizations. Accordingly, the
proposal would specify a hierarchy that banking organizations would be required to use to
identify the applicable look-through approach for each equity exposure to an investment fund
based on the nature and quality of the information available to the banking organization.
The proposal would also enhance the risk sensitivity of the current capital rule's look-
through approaches under subpart E by modifying the full look-through and the alternative look-
through approaches to explicitly capture off-balance sheet exposures held by an investment fund,
the counterparty credit risk and CVA risk of any underlying derivatives held by the investment
fund, and the leverage of an investment fund. The proposal would also replace the simple
modified look-through approach under subpart E with a flat 1,250 percent risk-weight.
Hierarchy of Look-Through Approaches
The proposal would require a banking organization that is not subject to the proposed
market risk capital framework to use the full look-through approach if the banking organization
has sufficient verified information about the underlying exposures of the investment fund to
i.
Page 170 of 1089
164
calculate a risk-weighted asset amount for each of the exposures held by the investment fund.¹
If a banking organization is unable to meet the criteria to use the full look-through approach, the
proposal would require the banking organization to apply the alternative modified look-through
approach and determine a risk-weighted asset amount for the exposures of the investment fund
based on the information contained in the investment fund's prospectus, partnership agreement,
or similar contract that defines the investment fund's permissible investments. If the banking
organization is unable to apply either the full look-through approach or the alternative modified
look-through approach, the proposal would require the banking organization to assign a 1,250
percent risk weight to the adjusted carrying value of the equity exposure to the investment fund.
Banking organizations generally would not be permitted to apply a combination of the above
approaches to determine the risk-weighted asset amount applicable to the adjusted carrying value
of an equity exposure to an investment fund, except for equity exposures to investment funds
with underlying securitizations, or equity exposures to other investment funds, as described in
section III.E.1.c.v. of this Supplementary Information.
ii. Full Look-Through Approach
Since the full look-through approach is the most granular and risk-sensitive approach, the
proposal would require banking organizations that are not subject to the proposed market risk
capital framework to use the full look-through approach when verified, detailed information
about the underlying exposures of the investment fund is available to enhance risk-sensitivity of
the risk-based capital requirements. Under the proposed hierarchy, such banking organizations
164 The proposal would require banking organizations subject to the market risk capital
requirements to apply the proposed market risk capital framework to determine the risk-weighted
asset amount for equity exposures to investment funds that would otherwise be subject to the full
look-through approach under the proposed equity framework. See §_.202 for the proposed
definition of market risk covered position.
Page 171 of 1089
would be required to use the full look-through approach if the banking organization is able to
calculate a risk-weighted asset amount for each of the underlying exposures of the investment
fund as if the exposures were held directly by the banking organization, with the exception of
securitization exposures, derivative exposures, and equity exposures to other investment funds,
as described in section III.E.1.c.v. of this Supplementary Information.
Specifically, the proposal would require banking organizations that are not subject to the
proposed market risk capital framework to apply the full look-through approach when there is
sufficient and frequent information provided to the banking organization regarding the
underlying exposures of the investment fund. To satisfy this criterion, the frequency of financial
reporting of the investment fund must be at least quarterly, and the financial information must be
sufficient for the banking organization to calculate the risk-weighted asset amount for each
exposure held by the investment fund as if each exposure were held directly by the banking
organization (except for securitization exposures, derivatives exposures, and equity exposures to
other investment funds). In addition, such information would be required to be verified on at
least a quarterly basis by an independent third party, such as a custodian bank or management
fund. 16
165
The proposal would largely maintain the same risk-weight treatment as provided under
the full look-through approach in the advanced approaches of the current capital rule, with five
exceptions. First, to facilitate application of the full look-through approach, the proposal would
allow banking organizations the option to use conservative alternative methods to those provided
under the proposed expanded risk-weighted asset approach to calculate the risk-weighted asset
165
As externally licensed auditors typically express their opinions on investment funds' accounts
rather than on the accuracy of the data used for the purposes of applying the full look-through
approach, an external audit would not be required.
Page 172 of 1089
amount attributable to any underlying exposures that are securitizations, derivatives, or equity
exposures to another investment fund, as described in section III.E.1.c.v. of this Supplementary
Information.
Second, to increase comparability across banking organizations, the proposal would
clarify that the total risk-weighted asset amount for the investment fund under the full look-
through approach must include any off-balance sheet exposures of the investment fund and the
counterparty credit risk and, where applicable, the CVA risk of any underlying derivative
exposures held by the investment fund. Accordingly, under the proposal, the total risk-weighted
asset amount for the investment fund under the full look-through approach would equal the sum
of the risk-weighted asset amount for (1) the on-balance sheet exposures, including any equity
exposures to other investment funds and securitization exposures; (2) the off-balance sheet
exposures, and (3) the counterparty credit risk and CVA risk, if applicable, of any underlying
derivative exposures held by the investment fund, as described in section III.E.1.c.v. of this
Supplementary Information. A banking organization would calculate the average risk weight for
an equity exposure to the investment fund by dividing the total risk-weighted asset amount for
the investment fund by the total assets of the investment fund.
Third, to capture the risk of equity exposures to investment funds with leverage, the full
look-through approach under the proposal would explicitly require banking organizations to
adjust the average risk weight for its equity exposure to the investment fund upwards to reflect
the leverage of the investment fund.¹66 Specifically, the proposal would require banking
166 While not done explicitly, the full look-through approach under the current capital rule does
capture the leverage of an investment fund.
Page 173 of 1089
organizations to multiply the average risk weight for its equity exposure to the investment fund
by the ratio of the total assets of the investment fund to the total equity of the investment fund.
Fourth, to avoid disincentivizing banking organizations from obtaining the necessary
information to apply the full-look through approach, the proposal would cap the risk weight for
an equity exposure to an investment fund under the full look-through approach at no more than
1,250 percent.
Fifth, consistent with the standardized approach under the current capital rule, to reflect
the agencies' and banking organizations' experience with money market fund investments and
similar investment funds during the 2008 financial crisis and the 2020 coronavirus response, the
proposal would floor the minimum risk weight that may be assigned to the adjusted carrying
value of any equity exposure to an investment fund under the proposed look-through approaches
at 20 percent. Accordingly, under the proposal, a banking organization would be required to
calculate the total risk-weighted asset amount for an equity exposure to an investment fund under
the full look-through approach by multiplying the adjusted carrying value of the equity exposure
by the applicable risk weight, as calculated according to the following formula provided under
section_.142(b) of the proposed rule:

credit risk and CVA risk, if applicable, of the derivative contracts held by the
investment fund, calculated as if each derivative contract were held directly by the
banking organization, unless the banking organization applies the alternative
approach described in section III.E.1.c.v. of this Supplementary Information;167
Total AssetSIF is the balance sheet total assets of the investment fund; and
Total Equity is the balance sheet total equity of the investment fund.
Question 70: What would be the advantages and disadvantages of allowing a banking
organization that does not have adequate data or information to determine the risk weight
associated with its equity exposure to an investment fund to rely on information from a source
other than the investment fund itself, if the risk weight would be increased (for example by a
factor of 1.2)? For what types of investment funds would a banking organization rely on a source
other than the investment fund itself to obtain this information and what types of entities would it
rely on to obtain this information?
iii. Alternative Modified Look-Through Approach
If a banking organization is unable to meet the criteria to use the full look-through
approach, the proposal would require the banking organization to use the alternative modified
167 Under the proposal, a banking organization may exclude equity derivative contracts held by
the investment fund for purposes of calculating the RWAderivatives component of the full and
alternative modified look-through approaches, if the banking organization has elected to exclude
equity derivative contracts for purposes of §__.113(d) of the proposal.
Page 175 of 1089
look-through approach, provided that the information contained in the investment fund's
prospectus, partnership agreement, or similar contract is sufficient to determine the risk weight
applicable to each exposure type in which the investment fund is permitted to invest. 168 To
account for the uncertain accuracy of risk assessments when banking organizations have limited
information about the underlying exposures of an investment fund or such information is not
verified on at least a quarterly basis by an independent third party, the alternative modified look-
through approach in the current capital rule requires banking organizations to use conservative
assumptions when calculating total risk-weighted assets for equity exposures to investment
funds.
The proposal would largely maintain the same risk-weight treatment as provided under
the alternative modified look-through approach in the advanced approaches of the current capital
rule, with five exceptions. First, to increase comparability of the risk-based capital requirements
applicable to equity exposures to investment funds with investment policies that permit the
investment fund to hold equity exposures to other investment funds or securitization exposures,
the proposed alternative modified look-through approach would specify the methods that
banking organizations would be required to use to calculate risk-weighted assets for such
underlying exposures, as described in section III.E.1.c.v. of this Supplementary Information.
Second, to capture the risk of equity exposures to investment funds with investment
policies that permit the use of off-balance sheet transactions or derivative contracts, the proposal
would require banking organizations to include the off-balance sheet transactions as well as the
168 Under the proposal, banking organizations subject to the proposed market risk capital
requirements would only apply the alternative modified look-through approach to such equity
exposures to investment funds if the banking organization is unable to obtain daily quotes for the
equity exposure to the investment fund. See §_.202 for the proposed definition of market risk
covered position.
Page 176 of 1089
counterparty credit risk and CVA risk, if applicable, of the derivative contracts, when calculating
the total risk-weighted asset amount for the investment fund. Specifically, the proposal would
require banking organizations to assume that the investment fund invests to the maximum extent
permitted under its investment limits in off-balance sheet transactions with the highest applicable
credit conversion factor and risk weight.169 The proposal would also require banking
organizations to assume that the investment fund has the maximum volume of derivative
contracts permitted under its investment limits. Under the proposal, the total risk-weighted asset
amount for the investment fund under the alternative modified look-through approach would
equal the sum of the following risk-weighted asset amounts: (1) the on-balance sheet exposures,
including any equity exposures to other investment funds and securitization exposures; (2) the
off-balance sheet exposures, and (3) the counterparty credit risk and CVA risk, if applicable, for
derivative exposures, as described in section III.E.1.c.v. of this Supplementary Information. A
banking organization would calculate the average risk weight for an equity exposure to the
investment fund by dividing the total risk-weighted asset amount for the investment fund by the
total assets of the investment fund.
Third, to capture the risk of equity exposures to investment funds with leverage, the
alternative modified look-through approach under the proposal would require a banking
organization to adjust the average risk weight for its equity exposure to the investment fund
169
For example, if the mandate of an investment entity permits the use of unconditional equity
commitments, the proposal would require the banking organization to multiply the notional
amount of the commitment by a 100 percent credit conversion factor and the risk weight
applicable to the underlying reference exposure of the commitment. If the banking organization
does not know the type of equity underlying the commitment, the banking organization would be
required to use the highest applicable risk-weight to equity exposures.
Page 177 of 1089
upwards by the ratio of the total assets of the investment fund to the total equity of the
investment fund.
Fourth, to avoid disincentivizing banking organizations from obtaining the necessary
information to apply the alternative modified look-through approach, the proposal would cap the
risk weight applicable to an equity exposure to an investment fund under the alternative modified
look-through approach at no more than 1,250 percent.
Fifth, consistent with the standardized approach under the current capital rule, to reflect
the agencies' and banking organizations' experience with money market fund investments and
similar investment funds during the 2008 financial crisis and the 2020 coronavirus response, the
proposal would floor the minimum risk weight that may be assigned to the adjusted carrying
value of any equity exposure to an investment fund under the proposed look-through approaches
at 20 percent.
Accordingly, under the proposal, a banking organization's risk-weighted asset amount for
an equity exposure to an investment fund under the alternative modified look-through approach
would be equal to the adjusted carrying value of the equity exposure multiplied by the lesser of
1,250 percent or the greater of either (1) the product of the average risk weight of the investment
fund multiplied by the leverage of the investment fund or (2) 20 percent.
iv. 1,250 percent risk weight
When banking organizations have limited information on the underlying exposures or the
leverage of the investment fund, they have limited ability to appropriately capture and manage
the risk and price volatility of such equity exposures. Accordingly, if a banking organization
does not have the necessary information to apply the full look-through approach or the
alternative modified look-through approach, the proposal would require the banking organization
Page 178 of 1089
to assign a 1,250 percent risk weight to the adjusted carrying value of its equity exposure to the
investment fund.
V. Risk weights for equity exposures to investment funds with underlying
securitizations, derivatives, or equity exposures to other investment funds
Banking organizations may not always be able to obtain the necessary information to
calculate risk-weighted asset amounts under the full look-though approach or the alternative
modified look-through approach for certain types of underlying exposures held by an investment
fund. For example, even if an investment fund provides detailed quarterly disclosures on all its
underlying assets and liabilities, such disclosures may not identify the actual counterparty to each
underlying derivative exposure of the investment fund or which of the underlying derivative
exposures of the investment fund are subject to the same qualified master netting agreement.
Furthermore, the information contained in an investment fund's prospectus, partnership
agreement, or similar contract may not always allow banking organizations to calculate risk-
weighted asset amounts for such underlying exposures under the alternative modified look-
through approach.
To facilitate application of the look-through approaches, the proposal would allow
banking organizations to use conservative assumptions to calculate risk-weighted asset amounts
under the full look-through approach for underlying exposures that are securitization exposures,
derivative exposures, or equity exposures to another investment fund. For purposes of the
alternative modified look-through approach, the proposal would require banking organizations to
use these alternative assumptions for such underlying exposures.
Page 179 of 1089
Securitization exposures
For any securitization exposures held by an investment fund, the proposal would allow a
banking organization using the full look-through approach to apply a 1,250 percent risk weight
to the exposure, if it cannot or chooses not to calculate the applicable risk weight under the
securitization standardized approach (SEC-SA), as described in section III.D. of this
Supplementary Information. The proposal would require a banking organization applying the
alternative modified look-through approach to apply a 1,250 percent risk weight to any
securitization exposures held by an investment fund.
II. Derivative exposures
For derivative exposures held by an investment fund, the proposal would require a
banking organization to calculate the risk-weighted asset amount for each derivative netting set
by multiplying the exposure amount of the netting set by the risk weight applicable to the
derivative counterparty under the proposed credit risk framework. To the extent a banking
organization cannot determine the counterparty, the proposal would require the banking
organization to multiply the resulting exposure amount by a 100 percent risk weight, as a
conservative approach to reflect the highest risk-weight that would be likely to apply to a
counterparty to such transactions. 170
For banking organizations using the full look-through approach, the proposal would
require a banking organization to use the replacement cost and the potential future exposure as
calculated under SA-CCR to determine the exposure amount for each netting set of underlying
170
I.
Relatedly, to the extent a banking organization is unable to determine the netting sets of the
underlying derivative exposures, the proposal would require each single derivative to be its own
netting set.
Page 180 of 1089
derivative exposures (including single derivative contracts)¹7¹ held by the investment fund,
where possible. 172 If a banking organization using the full look-through approach does not have
sufficient information to calculate the replacement cost or the potential future exposure for each
derivative netting set using SA-CCR or is using the alternative modified look-through approach,
the proposal would require the banking organization to use the notional amount of each netting
set and 15 percent of the notional amount of each netting set for the replacement cost and
potential future exposure, respectively. The proposal would require banking organizations using
the alternative modified look-through approach to use the notional amount of each netting set
and 15 percent of the notional amount of each netting set to determine the replacement cost and
potential future exposure, respectively. A banking organization would multiply the resulting
exposure amount by a factor of 1.4 if the banking organization determines that the counterparty
is not a commercial end-user or cannot determine whether the counterparty is a commercial end-
Additionally, the proposal would require a banking organization to further multiply the
exposure amount by a factor of 1.5 for each derivative netting set that either qualifies (or for
which the banking organization cannot determine whether the exposure qualifies) as a CVA risk
covered position, as defined in section III.I.3 of this Supplementary Information. Accordingly,
173
user.
171 The proposal would rely on the existing definition of netting set under the current capital rule,
which is defined to include a single derivative contract between a banking organization and a
single counterparty. See 12 CFR 3.2 (OCC); 12 CFR 217.2 (Board); 12 CFR 324.2 (FDIC).
172 Under the proposal, a banking organization may exclude equity derivative contracts held by
the investment fund for purposes of calculating the RWAderivatives component of the full and
alternative modified look-through approaches, if the banking organization has elected to exclude
equity derivative contracts for purposes of §___.113(d) of the proposal.
173 The proposal would rely on the existing definition of commercial end-user under the current
capital rule. See 12 CFR 3.2 (OCC); 12 CFR 217.2 (Board); 12 CFR 324.2 (FDIC).
Page 181 of 1089
the proposal would require banking organizations to calculate the exposure amount for derivative
exposures held by an investment fund as described in the following formula:
Exposure Amount = C *a (Replacement Cost + Potential Future Exposure)
Where
●
C would equal 1.5 if at least one of the derivative contracts in the netting set is a
CVA risk covered position or if the banking organization cannot determine
whether one or more of the derivative contracts within the netting set is a CVA
risk covered position; C would equal 1 if all of the derivative contracts within the
netting set are not CVA risk covered positions;
a would equal 1.4 if the banking organization determines that the counterparty is
not a commercial end-user or cannot determine whether the counterparty is a
commercial end-user, or 1 otherwise;
Replacement Cost would equal:
➤ The replacement cost as calculated under SA-CCR for purposes of the full
look-through approach, where possible; or
➤ The notional amount of the derivative contract if the banking organization
cannot determine replacement cost under SA-CCR or is using the alternative
modified look-through approach;
Potential Future Exposure would equal:
➤ The potential future exposure as calculated under SA-CCR¹74 for purposes
of the full look-through approach, where possible; or
174
If the banking organization is not able to calculate the replacement cost of the netting set
under SA-CCR but is able to calculate the PFE aggregated amount, the banking organization
must set the PFE multiplier equal to 1.
Page 182 of 1089
➤ 15 percent of the notional amount of the derivative contract if the banking
organization cannot determine the potential future exposure under SA-CCR
or is using the alternative modified look-through approach.
The proposal is intended to provide a conservative approach for banking organizations to
calculate risk-weighted asset amounts for the underlying derivative exposures held by an
investment fund in a manner that appropriately captures the risk of such positions. For example,
using 100 percent of the notional amount of the derivative contract as a proxy for the
replacement cost is intended to provide a standardized and simple input to the exposure amount
calculation when the necessary information about the replacement cost is not available. The
notional amount of the derivative contract is typically larger than the fair value or replacement
cost of the contract and thus providing a conservative estimate of the maximum exposure that
could arise for a derivative contract. Similarly, setting potential future exposure equal to 15
percent of the notional amount of the derivative contract is intended to provide a conservative
estimate of the potential losses that could arise from a counterparty credit risk exposure when the
likelihood of significant changes in the value of the exposure increases over the longer term.
III. Equity exposures to other investment funds
For an equity exposure to an investment fund (e.g., Investment Fund A) that itself has a
direct equity exposure to another investment fund (e.g., Investment Fund B), the proposal would
require a banking organization to determine the proportional amount of risk-weighted assets of
Investment Fund A attributable to the underlying equity exposure to Investment Fund B using
the hierarchy of approaches described in section III.E.1.c.i. of this Supplementary Information.
That is, the banking organization may be required to apply the same or another approach to
determine the risk-weighted asset amount for Investment Fund A's equity exposure to
Page 183 of 1089
Investment Fund B than was used for the banking organization's equity exposure to Investment
Fund A, based on the nature and quality of the information available to the banking organization
regarding the underlying assets and liabilities of Investment Fund B.
For all subsequent indirect equity exposure layers (e.g., Investment Fund B's equity
exposure to Investment Fund C and so forth), the proposal would generally require the banking
organization to assign a 1,250 percent risk weight, with one exception. If the banking
organization applied the full look-through approach to calculate risk-weighted assets for the
equity exposure to the investment fund at the previous layer, the banking organization would be
required to apply the full-look through approach to any subsequent layer when there is sufficient
and frequent information provided to the banking organization regarding the underlying
exposures of that particular investment fund. If there is not sufficient and frequent information to
apply the full look-through approach to the subsequent layer, then the banking organization
would be required to assign a 1,250 percent risk weight to the subsequent layer.
Question 71: The agencies invite comment on the impact of the proposed expanded risk-
based framework for equity exposures. What are the pros and cons of the proposal and what, if
any, unintended consequences might the proposed treatment pose with respect to a banking
organization's equity exposures? Provide data to support the response.
Question 72: The agencies solicit comment on all aspects of the proposed treatment of
equity exposures to investment funds. What, if any, challenges could implementing the full look-
through approach, the alternative modified look-through approach, or the 1,250 percent risk
weight pose for banking organizations? What, if any, clarifications or modifications should the
agencies consider making to the proposed look-through approaches and why? To what extent
would equity exposures to investment funds be captured under the proposed look-through
Page 184 of 1089
approaches in equity exposure framework as opposed to the market risk framework? Which
type(s) of investment funds would present challenges under the proposed methods? What other
methods should the agencies consider to more accurately capture such exposures' risk that
would still help promote simplicity and transparency of risk-based capital requirements?
Question 73: What, if any, modifications should the agencies consider to more
appropriately capture the risk of underlying derivatives exposures held by an investment fund
and why? The agencies seek comment on the appropriateness of the proposed alternative method
for banking organizations to calculate risk-weighted asset amounts for derivative exposures held
by an investment fund if the banking organization does not have sufficient information to use SA-
CCR. What would be the benefits and drawbacks of excluding derivative contracts that are used
for hedging rather than speculative purposes and that do not constitute a material portion of the
investment entity's exposures?
F. Operational risk
The proposal would introduce a capital requirement for operational risk based on a
standardized approach (standardized approach for operational risk). The current capital rule
defines operational risk as the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes,
people, and systems, or from external events. Operational risk includes legal risk but excludes
strategic and reputational risk. ¹75 Experience shows that operational risk is inherent in all
banking products, activities, processes, and systems.
Under the current capital rule, banking organizations subject to Category I or II capital
standards are required to calculate risk-weighted assets for operational risk using the advanced
175
See 12 CFR 3.101 (OCC), 217.101 (Board), and 12 CFR 324.101 (FDIC).
Page 185 of 1089
measurement approaches (AMA), 1¹76 which are based on a banking organization's internal
models. The AMA results in significant challenges for banking organizations, market
participants, and the supervisory process. AMA exposure estimates can present substantial
uncertainty and volatility, which introduces challenges to capital planning processes. ¹77 In
addition, the AMA's reliance on internal models has resulted in a lack of transparency and
comparability across banking organizations. As a result, supervisors and market participants
experience challenges in assessing the relative magnitude of operational risk across banking
organizations, evaluating the adequacy of operational risk capital, and determining the
effectiveness of operational risk management practices. To address these concerns, the proposal
would remove the AMA and introduce a standardized approach for operational risk that seeks to
address the operational risks currently covered by the AMA.
The operational risk capital requirements under the standardized approach for operational
risk would be a function of a banking organization's business indicator component and internal
oss multiplier. The business indicator component would provide a measure of the operational
risk exposure of the banking organization and would be calculated based on its business indicator
multiplied by scaling factors that increase with the business indicator. The business indicator
would serve as a proxy for a banking organization's business volume and would be based on
inputs compiled from a banking organization's financial statements. The internal loss multiplier
176
The agencies adopted the AMA for operational risk as part of the advanced approaches capital
framework in 2007. See 72 FR 69288 (December 7, 2007).
177
See, e.g., Cope, E., G. Mignola, G. Antonini, and R. Ugoccioni. 2009. Challenges and Pitfalls
in Measuring Operational Risk from Loss Data. Journal of Operational Risk 4(4): 3–27; and
Opdyke, J., and A. Cavallo. 2012. Estimating Operational Risk Capital: The Challenges of
Truncation, the Hazards of Maximum Likelihood Estimation, and the Promise of Robust
Statistics. Journal of Operational Risk 7(3): 3–90.
Page 186 of 1089
would be based on the ratio of a banking organization's historical operational losses to its
business indicator component and would increase the operational risk capital requirement as
historical operational losses increase. To help ensure the robustness of the operational risk capital
requirement, the proposal would require that the internal loss multiplier be no less than one.
A banking organization's operational risk capital requirement would be equal to its
business indicator component multiplied by its internal loss multiplier. Similar to the current
capital rule, risk-weighted assets for operational risk would be equal to 12.5 times the operational
risk capital requirement.
1. Business indicator
Under the proposal, the business indicator would be based on the sum of the following
three components: an interest, lease, and dividend component; a services component; and a
financial component. Each component would serve as a measure of a broad category of activities
in which banking organizations typically engage. Given that operational risk is inherent in all
banking products, activities, processes, and systems, these components aim to capture
comprehensively the volume of a banking organization's financial activities and thus serve as a
proxy for a banking organization's business volume. The interest, lease, and dividend component
aims to capture lending and investment activities through measures of interest income, interest
expense, interest-earning assets, and dividends. The services component aims to capture fee and
commission-based activities as well as other banking activities, such as those resulting in other
operating income and other operating expense. Lastly, the financial component aims to capture
trading activity and other activities that are associated with a banking organization's assets and
liabilities.

Banking organizations with higher overall business volume are larger and more complex,
which likely results in exposure to higher operational risk.178 Higher business volumes present
more opportunities for operational risk to manifest. In addition, the complexities associated with
a higher business volume can give rise to gaps or other deficiencies in internal controls that result
in operational losses. Therefore, higher overall business volume would correlate with higher
operational risk capital requirements under the proposal.
Under the proposal, all inputs to the business indicator would be based on three-year
rolling averages. For example, when calculating the three-year average for a business indicator
input reported at the end of the third calendar quarter of 2023, the values of the item for the
fourth quarter of 2020 through the third quarter of 2021, the fourth quarter of 2021 through the
third quarter of 2022, and the fourth quarter of 2022 through the third quarter of 2023 would be
averaged. The one exception is interest-earning assets, which would be calculated as the average
of the quarterly values of interest-earning assets for the previous 12 quarters.

Operational Risk, Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas,

179 Unlike the other inputs used to calculate the business indicator, interest-earning assets are
balance-sheet items, rather than income statement items, and thus their use in the business
indicator does not represent a flow over a one-year period, but rather a point-in-time value. The
use of average interest-earning assets for the previous 12 quarters instead of, for example, the
average interest-earning assets for the ending quarter of the last three years aims to increase the
robustness of the average used in the calculation.
Page 188 of 1089
The use of three-year averages would capture a banking organization's activities over
time and help reduce the impact of temporary fluctuations. Basing the business indicator on a
shorter time period, such as a single year of data, would likely result in a more volatile capital
requirement, which could make it more difficult for banking organizations to incorporate the
operational risk capital requirement into capital planning processes and could result in unduly
low or high operational risk capital requirements given temporary changes in a banking
organization's activities. Alternatively, basing the business indicator on too many years of data
could reduce its responsiveness to changes in a banking organization's activities, which could in
turn weaken the relationship between the capital requirements and the banking organization's
risk profile. Based on these considerations, the use of three-year averages aims to balance the
stability and responsiveness of a banking organization's operational risk capital requirement.
As described below, the inputs used in each component of the business indicator would,
in most cases, use information contained in line items from schedules RI and RC of the Call
Report and schedules HI and HC of the FR Y-9C report, as applicable. The agencies are planning
to separately propose modifications to the FFIEC 101 report so that all inputs to the business
indicator (described below) as well as total net operational losses (described further below)
would be publicly reported as separate inputs to the applicable calculations.
The inputs to each component of the business indicator would not be meant to overlap.
Income and expenses would not be counted in more than one component of the business
indicator, consistent with instructions to the regulatory reports and the principles of accounting.
The inputs used to calculate the business indicator would include data relative to entities
that have been acquired by, or merged with, the banking organization over the period prior to the
acquisition or merger that is relevant to the calculation of the business indicator.
Page 189 of 1089
a. The interest, lease, and dividend component
Under the proposal, the interest, lease, and dividend component would account for
activities that produce interest, lease, and dividend income and would be calculated as follows:
Interest, lease, and dividend component
The proposal includes the following definitions:
●
●
= min (Avg3y(Abs(total interest income
- total interest expense)), 0.0225 * Avg3y(interest earning assets))
+ Avg3y (dividend income)
●
Total interest income would mean interest income from all financial assets and other
interest income; ¹
180
Total interest expense would mean interest expenses related to all financial liabilities
and other interest expenses;¹
.181
Dividend income would mean all dividends received on securities not consolidated in
the banking organization's financial statements; 182 and
180 Total interest income would correspond to total interest income in the FR Y-9C (holding
companies) and Call Report, excluding dividend income as defined in the proposal.
181 Total interest expense would correspond to total interest expense in the FR Y-9C (holding
companies) and Call Report.
182 Dividend income is currently included in total interest income in the FR Y-9C (holding
companies) and Call Report.
Page 190 of 1089
●
Interest-earning assets would mean the sum of all gross outstanding loans and leases,
securities that pay interest, interest-bearing balances, federal funds sold, and
securities purchased under agreements to resell.¹8
183
The interest, lease, and dividend component aims to capture a banking organization's
interest income and expenses from financial assets and liabilities, as well as dividend income
from investments in stocks and mutual funds.
The interest income and expenses portion is calculated as the absolute value of the
difference between total interest income and total interest expense (which constitutes net interest
income) and is subject to a ceiling equal to 2.25 percent of the banking organization's total
interest-earning assets. Net interest income is a useful indicator of a banking organization's
operational risk because a higher volume of business is associated with higher operational risk.
Because operational risk does not necessarily increase proportionally to increases in net interest
income, the net interest income input would be capped at 2.25 percent of interest-earning assets.
The proposal would add dividend income to the net interest income input to capture
investment activities that do not produce interest income (for example, investment in equities and
mutual funds).
b. The services component
183 Interest-earning assets would equal the sum of interest-bearing balances in U.S. offices,
interest-bearing balances in foreign offices, Edge and agreement subsidiaries, and IBFs, federal
funds sold in domestic offices, securities purchased under agreements to resell, loans and leases
held for sale, loans and leases, held for investment, total held-to-maturity securities at amortized
cost (only including securities that pay interest), total available-for-sale securities at fair value
(only including securities that pay interest), and total trading assets (only including trading assets
that pay interest) in the FR Y-9C (holding companies) and Call Report.
Page 191 of 1089
Under the proposal, the services component would account for activities that result in
fees and commissions and other financial activities not captured by the other components of the
business indicator. The services component would be calculated as follows:
Services component
= max (Avg3y (fee and commission income), Avg3y(fee and commission expense))
+ max (Avg3y (other operating income), Avg3y (other operating expense))
The proposal includes the following definitions:
●
●
Fee and commission income would mean income received from providing advisory
and financial services, including insurance income; ¹84
Fee and commission expense would mean expenses paid by the banking organization
for advisory and financial services received;¹
185
184
Fee and commission income would include the sum of income from fiduciary activities,
service charges on deposit accounts in domestic offices; fees and commissions from securities
brokerage; investment banking, advisory, and underwriting fees and commissions; fees and
commissions from annuity sales; income and fees from printing and sale of checks; income and
fees from automated teller machines; safe deposit box rent; bank card and credit card interchange
fees; income and fees from wire transfers; underwriting income from insurance and reinsurance
activities; and income from other insurance activities in the FR Y-9C (holding companies) and
Call Report. Fee and commission income would also include servicing fees on a gross basis,
which would correspond to net servicing fees in the FR Y-9C (holding companies) and Call
Report, with the modification that expenses should not be netted, because fee and commission
expenses should not be netted in the calculation of fee and commission income. In addition, fee
and commission income would include other income received from providing advice and
financial services that is not currently itemized in the regulatory reports.
185 Fee and commission expense would include consulting and advisory expenses and automated
teller machine and interchange expenses in the FR Y-9C (holding companies) and Call Report.
Fee and commission expense would also include any other expenses paid for advice and
financial services received that are not currently itemized in the regulatory reports.
Page 192 of 1089
● Other operating income would mean income not included in other elements of the
business indicator and not excluded from the business indicator; 186
36 
and
Other operating expense would mean expenses associated with financial services not
included in other elements of the business indicator and all expenses associated with
operational loss events (expenses associated with operational loss events would not
be included in other business indicator items). 187 Other operating expense would not
include expenses excluded from the business indicator.
●
The services component would reflect a banking organization's income and expenses
from fees and commissions as well as its other operating income and expenses.
The fee and commission elements and the other operating elements of the services
component would be calculated as gross amounts, reflecting the larger of either income or
expense. This approach would account for the different business models of banking
organizations better than a netting approach, which may lead to variances in the services
component that exaggerate differences in operational risk. For example, using income net of
expense as the indicator would result in the services component for banking organizations that
only distribute products bought from third parties, for which expenses would be netted from
Note that fee and commission expense would include fees paid by the banking organization as a
result of outsourcing financial services, but not fees paid for outsourced non-financial services
(e.g., logistical, information technology, human resources).
186
Other operating income would include rent and other income from other real estate owned in
the FR Y-9C (holding companies) and Call Report. Other operating income would also include
all other income items not currently itemized in the regulatory reports, which are not included in
other business indicator items and are not specifically excluded from the business indicator.
187
Note that expenses with operational loss events in "other operating expense" would not
exclude expenses associated with operational loss events that result in less than $20,000 in net
loss amount.
Page 193 of 1089
income, being substantially lower than the services component of banking organizations that
originate products to distribute, which would generally not have many financial expenses to net
from income. Therefore, a netting approach would likely exaggerate the difference in operational
risk between these two business models.
The proposal would include in the services component the income and expense of a banking
organization's insurance activities. The agencies intend for the operational risk capital
requirement to reflect all operational risks to which a banking organization is exposed, regardless
of the activity or legal entity in which the operational risk resides.
Question 74: What are the advantages and disadvantages of the proposed approach to
calculating the services component, including any impacts on specific business models? Which
alternatives, if any, should the agencies consider and why? Similarly, should the agencies
consider any adjustments or limits related to specific business lines, such as underwriting,
wealth management, or custody, or to specific fee types, such as interchange fees, and if so what
adjustment or limits should they consider? For example, should the agencies consider adjusting
or limiting how the services component contributes to the business indicator and, if so, how?
What would be the advantages and disadvantages of any alternative approach and what impact
would such an alternative approach have on operational risk capital requirements? For
example, under the proposal, fee income and expenses of charge cards are included under the
services component. Would it be more appropriate for fee income and expenses of charge cards
to be included in net interest income of the interest, lease, and dividend component (and
excluded from the services component) and for charge card exposures to be included in interest
earning assets of the interest, lease, and dividend component and why? Please provide
supporting data with your response.

C.
The financial component
Under the proposal, the financial component would capture trading activities and other
activities associated with a banking organization's assets and liabilities. The financial component
would be calculated as follows:
Financial component
= Avg3y (Abs (trading revenue))
+ Avg3y(Abs(net profit or loss on assets and liabilities not held for trading))
The proposal includes the following definitions:
●
Trading revenue would mean the net gain or loss from trading cash instruments and
derivative contracts (including commodity contracts);¹ and
188
Net profit or loss on assets and liabilities not held for trading would mean the sum of
realized gains (losses) on held-to-maturity securities, realized gains (losses) on
available-for-sale securities, net gains (losses) on sales of loans and leases, net gains
(losses) on sales of other real estate owned, net gains (losses) on sales of other assets,
venture capital revenue, net securitization income, and mark-to-market profit or loss
on bank liabilities. 189
188 Trading revenue would correspond to trading revenue in the FR Y-9C (holding companies)
and Call Report.
189
Realized gains (losses) on held-to-maturity securities, realized gains (losses) on available-for-
sale securities, net gains (losses) on sales of loans and leases, net gains (losses) on sales of other
real estate owned, net gains (losses) on sales of other assets, venture capital revenue, and net
securitization income correspond to their current definitions in the FR Y-9C (holding companies)
and Call Report.
Page 195 of 1089
The financial component aims to capture trading activities and other activities that are
associated with a banking organization's assets and liabilities. Trading revenue, which reflects
net income or loss from trading activities, would be a proxy for the business volume associated
with trading and related activities. Net profit or loss on assets and liabilities not held for trading
would reflect the profit or loss of activities associated with assets and liabilities that are not
included by other components of the business indicator and therefore ensures that the business
indicator comprehensively captures these activities. The use of net values for these inputs would
align with current regulatory reporting, thereby reducing data gathering and calculation burden.
Both of these inputs would be measured in terms of their absolute value to better capture
business volume (for example, negative trading revenue would not imply that a banking
organization's trading activities are small in volume), which is associated with higher operational
risk.
d. Exclusions from the business indicator
Under the proposal, the business indicator would reflect the volume of financial activities
of a banking organization; therefore, the business indicator would exclude expenses that do not
relate to financial services received by the banking organization. Excluded expenses would
include staff expenses, expenses to outsource non-financial services (such as logistical, human
resources, and information technology), administrative expenses (such as utilities,
telecommunications, travel, office supplies, and postage), expenses relating to premises and
fixed assets, and depreciation of tangible and intangible assets. Still, the proposal would include
expenses related to operational loss events in the services component even when they relate to
these otherwise-excluded categories of expenses because the objective of the operational risk
capital requirement is to support a banking organization's resilience to operational risk, and
Page 196 of 1089
observed operational loss expenses are a meaningful indicator of a banking organization's
exposure to operational risk.
The proposal also would not include loss provisions and reversal of provisions (except
for those related to operational loss events) or changes in goodwill in the business indicator, as
these items do not reflect business volume of the banking organization. In addition, the business
indicator would not include applicable income taxes as an expense, as they reflect obligations to
the government for which the operational risk capital framework should be neutral.
With prior supervisory approval, the proposal would allow banking organizations to
exclude activities that they have ceased to conduct, whether directly or indirectly, from the
calculation of the business indicator, provided that the banking organization demonstrates that
such activities do not carry legacy legal exposure. Supervisory approval would not be granted
when, for example, legacy business activities are subject to potential or pending legal or
regulatory enforcement action. The supervisory approval requirement would help ensure that a
banking organization's operational risk capital requirement aligns with its existing operational
risk exposure.
2. Business indicator component
Under the proposal, the business indicator component would be a function of the business
indicator, with three linear segments. The business indicator component would increase at a rate
of: (a) 12 percent per unit of business indicator for levels of business indicator up to $1 billion;
(b) 15 percent per unit of business indicator for levels of business indicator above $1 billion and
up to $30 billion; and (c) 18 percent per unit of business indicator for levels of business indicator
Page 197 of 1089
above $30 billion. The table below presents the formulas that can be used to calculate the
business indicator component given a banking organization's business indicator.
Business indicator range
$0 to $1 billion
> $1 billion to $30 billion
> $30 billion
The higher rate of increase of the business indicator component as a banking
organization's business indicator rises above $1 billion and $30 billion would reflect exposure to
operational risk generally increasing more than proportionally with a banking organization's
overall business volume, in part due to the increased complexity of large banking organizations.
This approach is supported by analysis undertaken by the Basel Committee. ¹⁹¹ Similarly,
academic studies have found that larger U.S. bank holding companies have higher operational
losses per dollar of total assets.
192
Business indicator component ¹⁹0
0.12 * Business Indicator (BI)
$120 million + 0.15 * (BI - $1 billion)
$4.47 billion + 0.18 * (BI - $30 billion)
3. Internal loss multiplier
1⁹0 $120 million is equal to 0.12 * $1 billion. $4.47 billion is equal to 0.12 * $1 billion + 0.15 *
($30 billion - $1 billion).

Operational Risk," Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas,

Page 198 of 1089
Higher historical operational losses are associated with higher future operational risk
exposure. Supervisory experience also suggests that operational risk management deficiencies
can be persistent, which can often result in operational losses. Accordingly, under the proposal,
the operational risk capital requirement would be higher for banking organizations that
experienced larger operational losses in the past. To this effect, the proposal would include a
scalar, the internal loss multiplier, that increases operational risk capital requirements based on a
banking organization's historical operational loss experience. This multiplier would depend on
the ratio of a banking organization's average annual total net operational losses to its business
indicator component.
193
The proposal would require the internal loss multiplier to be no less than one. This floor
would ensure that the operational risk capital requirement provides a robust minimum amount of
coverage to the potential future operational risks a banking organization may be exposed to, as
reflected by its overall business volume through the business indicator component, even in
situations where historical operational losses have been low in relative terms.
The internal loss multiplier would be calculated as follows:
Internal Loss Multiplier
{1, in (exp(1
= maximum 1, In
exp(1) – 1
15 x Average Annual Total Net Operational Losses
Business Indicator Component
0.8
193 See Curti and Migueis (2023), “The Information Value of Past Losses in Operational Risk,
Finance and Economics Discussion Series," Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System,
https://doi.org/10.17016/FEDS.2023.003.
Page 199 of 1089
Where:
Average annual total net operational losses would correspond to the average of annual
total net operational losses over the previous ten years (on a rolling quarter basis).¹⁹4 In
this calculation, the total net operational losses of a quarter would equal the sum of any
portions of losses or recoveries of any material operational losses allocated to the
quarter. Material operational loss would mean an operational loss incurred by the
banking organization that resulted in a net loss greater than or equal to $20,000 after
taking into account all subsequent recoveries related to the operational loss.
Exp(1) is the Euler's number, which is approximately equal to 2.7183.
In is the natural logarithm.
Average annual total net operational losses would be multiplied by 15 in the internal loss
multiplier formula. This multiplication extrapolates from average annual total net operational
losses the potential for unusually large losses and, therefore, aims to ensure that a banking
organization maintains sufficient capital given its operational loss history and risk profile. The
constant used is consistent with the Basel III reforms.
The natural log function (ln) combined with an exponent of 0.8 would limit the effect that
large operational losses have on a banking organization's operational risk capital requirement.
This feature of the internal loss multiplier formula is intended to constrain the volatility of the
194
For example, when calculating average annual total net operational losses for the second
calendar quarter of 2023, total net operational losses from the third calendar quarter of 2013
through the second calendar quarter of 2023 would be included.
Page 200 of 1089
operational risk capital requirement. As a result, increases in average annual total net operational
losses would increase the operational risk capital requirement at a decreasing rate.195
The calculation of average annual total net operational losses would be based on an
average of ten years of data. The use of a ten-year average for annual total net operational losses
would balance recognition that a banking organization's operational risk exposure changes over
time with limiting the volatility that would result from using a shorter time horizon and the
importance of the calculation window providing sufficient information regarding the banking
organization's operational risk profile.
The proposal would define an "operational loss” as all losses (excluding insurance or tax
effects) resulting from an operational loss event, including any reduction in previously reported
capital levels attributable to restatements or corrections of financial statements. An operational
loss includes all expenses associated with an operational loss event except for opportunity costs,
forgone revenue, and costs related to risk management and control enhancements implemented
to prevent future operational losses. Operational loss would not include losses that are also credit
losses and are related to exposures within the scope of the credit risk risk-weighted assets
framework (except for retail credit card losses arising from non-contractual, third-party-initiated
fraud, which are operational losses).
195 The internal loss multiplier variation depends on the ratio of the product of 15 and the average
annual total operational losses to the business indicator component. The 0.8 exponent applied to
this ratio reduces the effect of the variation of this ratio on the internal loss multiplier. For
example, a ratio of 2 becomes approximately 1.74 after application of the exponent, and a ratio
of 0.5 becomes approximately 0.57 after application of the exponent. Similarly, the application
of a logarithmic function further reduces the variability of the internal loss multiplier for values
above 1. Taken together, these two transformations mitigate the reaction of the operational risk
capital requirement to large historical operational losses.
Page 201 of 1089
"Operational loss event" would be defined as an event that results in loss due to
inadequate or failed internal processes, people, or systems or from external events. This
definition includes legal loss events and restatements or corrections of financial statements that
result in a reduction of capital relative to amounts previously reported. The proposal would retain
the current classification of operational loss events according to seven event types:
1 · Internal fraud, which means the operational loss event type that comprises operational
losses resulting from an act involving at least one internal party of a type intended to defraud,
misappropriate property, or circumvent regulations, the law, or company policy excluding
diversity and discrimination noncompliance events.
2 – External fraud, which means the operational loss event type that comprises
operational losses resulting from an act by a third party of a type intended to defraud,
misappropriate property, or circumvent the law. Retail credit card losses arising from non-
contractual, third-party-initiated fraud (for example, identity theft) are external fraud operational
losses.
3 - Employment practices and workplace safety, which means the operational loss event
type that comprises operational losses resulting from an act inconsistent with employment,
health, or safety laws or agreements, payment of personal injury claims, or payment arising from
diversity and discrimination noncompliance events.
4 - Clients, products, and business practices, which means the operational loss event type
that comprises operational losses resulting from the nature or design of a product or from an
unintentional or negligent failure to meet a professional obligation to specific clients (including
fiduciary and suitability requirements).
Page 202 of 1089
5 - Damage to physical assets, which means the operational loss event type that
comprises operational losses resulting from the loss of or damage to physical assets from natural
disasters or other events.
6 – Business disruption and system failures, which means the operational loss event type
that comprises operational losses resulting from disruption of business or system failures,
including hardware, software, telecommunications, or utility outage or disruptions.
7- Execution, delivery, and process management, which means the operational loss
event type that comprises operational losses resulting from failed transaction processing or
process management or losses arising from relations with trade counterparties and vendors.
By ensuring consistency, the classification of operational loss events according to these
event types would continue to assist banking organizations and the agencies in understanding the
causal factors driving operational losses.
The proposal would include a $20,000 net loss threshold (that is, $20,000 after taking
into account all subsequent recoveries related to the operational loss) for inclusion of an
operational loss in the calculation of average annual total net operational losses. This threshold
aims to balance comprehensiveness against the materiality of the operational losses.
The proposal would require a banking organization to group losses with a common
underlying trigger into the same operational loss event. For example, losses that occur in
multiple locations or over a period of time resulting from the same natural disaster would be
grouped into a single operational loss event. This grouping requirement aims to ensure
comprehensive inclusion of operational loss events that result in $20,000 or more of net loss in
