The document provides a comprehensive overview of the treatment and calculation of derivative contracts under a variation margin agreement for Board-regulated institutions. 

In terms of the treatment of derivative contracts, an institution can elect to treat one derivative contract under a variation margin agreement, but all other derivative contracts within the same netting set that are eligible for an election must also be treated as such. The institution may also choose to treat a credit, equity, or commodity derivative contract that references an index as multiple derivative contracts each referencing one component of the index.

The replacement cost of a netting set subject to a variation margin agreement is calculated using specific formulas. For netting sets not subject to a variation margin agreement, the replacement cost is calculated differently. For multiple netting sets subject to a single variation margin agreement, the replacement cost must be calculated according to paragraph (c)(10)(i) of this section. For a netting set subject to multiple variation margin agreements or a hybrid netting set, the replacement cost must be calculated according to paragraph (c)(11)(i) of this section.

The document also discusses the calculation of the adjusted notional amount for different types of derivative contracts. For an interest rate or credit derivative contract, the adjusted notional amount is calculated using the notional amount of the contract and the supervisory duration. For an exchange rate derivative contract, the adjusted notional amount is calculated using the notional amount of the non-U.S. denominated currency leg of the contract. For an equity or commodity derivative contract, the adjusted notional amount is calculated using the fair value of one unit of the reference instrument underlying the contract and the number of such units referenced by the contract.

The supervisory delta adjustments for derivative contracts are explained. For a derivative contract that is not an option contract or collateralized debt obligation tranche, the supervisory delta adjustment is 1 or -1 depending on the fair value of the derivative contract. For an option contract, the supervisory delta adjustment is determined by specific formulas.

The document provides a table for the assignment of counterparty weight based on the internal probability of default (PD). The weight ranges from 0.70% to 10.00% for internal PDs from 0.00% to >6.00%.

The advanced CVA approach is discussed, where a Board-regulated institution may use the VaR model to calculate its CVA capital requirement for a counterparty by modeling the impact of changes in the counterparties' credit spreads, together with any recognized CVA hedges.

The calculation of the hedging set amount for different types of derivative contracts is outlined. For interest rate derivative contracts, three variables are defined: AddOnIRTB1, AddOnIRTB2, and AddOnIRTB3. For exchange rate derivative contracts, the hedging set amount is the absolute value of the sum of the adjusted derivative contract amounts within the hedging set.

The rules for determining the Margin Period of Risk (MPOR) for different types of derivative contracts are outlined. The MPOR cannot be less than ten business days for a non-client-facing derivative contract and five business days for a client-facing derivative contract.

The maturity factor of a derivative contract that is not subject to a variation margin agreement, or derivative contracts under which the counterparty is not required to post variation margin, is determined by a specific formula. A Board-regulated institution must treat a cleared transaction that is not subject to a variation margin agreement as one that is subject to a variation margin agreement.

For a binary option, the option must be treated as two separate options. A binary option with strike K must be represented as the combination of one bought European option and one sold European option of the same type as the original option (put or call) with the strikes set equal to 0.95 * K and 1.05 * K.

Institutions must use a consistent methodology to calculate the exposure amount for all derivative contracts. Any changes to this methodology require prior approval from the Board. The EAD can be reduced by the credit valuation adjustment recognized in the balance sheet valuation of any derivative contracts in the netting set. However, this adjustment does not include any changes to common equity tier 1 capital due to changes in the institution's own credit risk.

The document provides definitions for terms used in the context of derivative contracts. The 'end date' refers to the last date of the period referenced by an interest rate or credit derivative contract or the underlying instrument. The 'start date' is the first date of the period referenced by these contracts or instruments. A 'hedging set' refers to all contracts within a netting set that reference the same currency, commodity category, pair of risk factors, or risk factors depending on the type of derivative contract.

For credit derivatives, a Board-regulated institution that purchases a credit derivative recognized as a credit risk mitigant for an exposure that is not a covered position is not required to calculate a separate counterparty credit risk.

The document discusses the margin period of risk for Over The Counter (OTC) derivative contracts or netting set of OTC derivative contracts. The margin period should be extended to cover any impediments to prompt re-hedging of any market risk. The standard period is five business days, but this can be extended if deemed necessary by the Board-regulated institution or the Board itself, based on the nature, structure, or characteristics of the transaction or the associated risks.

The document also discusses the calculation of alpha, which is the ratio of economic capital from a full simulation of counterparty exposure (numerator) and economic capital based on Expected Positive Exposure (EPE) (denominator), subject to a floor of 1.2. The calculation of alpha must capture the effects of material sources of stochastic dependency, volatilities and correlations of market risk factors, and the granularity of exposures. The Board-regulated institution must also assess potential model uncertainty in its estimates of alpha and ensure consistency in the calculation of the numerator and denominator of alpha. The estimates of alpha must be reviewed and adjusted at least quarterly or more frequently if the portfolio composition varies over time.

The document mentions risk-based capital requirements for transactions with specific wrong-way risk. The Board-regulated institution must determine if a repo-style transaction, eligible margin loan, bond option, or equity derivative contract or purchased credit derivative has specific wrong-way risk.

The document provides supervisory parameters for derivative contracts across various asset classes. For interest rate and exchange rate derivatives, the supervisory option volatility is 50% and 15% respectively, with a supervisory factor of 0.50% and 4.0% respectively. For credit derivatives, the supervisory option volatility is 100% for all categories (investment grade, speculative grade, sub-speculative), with supervisory correlation factors of 50% and supervisory factors of 0.46%, 1.3%, and 6.0% respectively.

The document outlines the calculation of potential future exposure for a netting set subject to multiple variation margin agreements. The netting set must be divided into sub-netting sets and the aggregated amount for each sub-netting set calculated. The aggregated amount for the netting set is the sum of the aggregated amounts for the sub-netting sets. The multiplier is calculated for the entire netting set.

The document discusses the effects of collateral agreements on Exposure at Default (EAD) for Board-regulated institutions. Two methods are available to capture the effect of a collateral agreement. The first method allows the institution to include the effect of a collateral agreement within its internal model used to calculate EAD, with prior approval from the Board. The second method is an alternative for institutions that can model Expected Positive Exposure (EPE) without collateral agreements but cannot achieve the higher level of modeling sophistication to model EPE with collateral agreements.

The margin period of risk for a netting set subject to a collateral agreement is five business days for repo-style transactions subject to daily re-margining and daily marking-to-market, and ten business days for other transactions when liquid financial collateral is posted under a daily margin maintenance requirement. It is twenty business days if the number of trades in a netting set exceeds 5,000 at any time during the previous quarter or contains one or more trades involving illiquid collateral or any derivative contract that cannot be easily replaced. If over the two previous quarters more than two margin disputes on a netting set have occurred that lasted more than the margin period of risk, then the institution must use a margin period of risk for that netting set that is at least two times the minimum margin period of risk for that netting set.
