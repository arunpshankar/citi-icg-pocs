The rule requires national banks and federal savings associations with total consolidated assets of $50 billion or more to make public disclosures about their risk-weighted assets and capital ratios. \n",
      "The rule also establishes four categories of national banks and federal savings associations based on their size and cross-jurisdictional activity. The category a bank or savings association falls into determines the level of public disclosure required. \n",
      "The rule also makes a number of changes to the definitions of various terms used in the capital rules, including \"total risk-weighted assets,\" \"market risk-weighted assets,\" and \"credit risk-weighted assets.\"\n",
      "The document revises and redesignates footnote 10 of § 324.4, amends § 324.10 by revising paragraphs (a)(1)(v), (b) introductory text, (b)(5), paragraph (c), paragraph (d) heading and introductory text, (d)(3)(ii), and (d)(4), amends § 324.11 by removing the words \"advanced approaches FDIC-supervised institution or a Category III FDIC-supervised institution” from paragraph (b)(1) and adding, in their place, the words “FDIC-supervised institution subject to subpart E of this part”, amends § 324.12 by removing paragraph (a)(4), amends § 324.20 by revising paragraphs (c)(1)(xiv), (d)(1)(xi), and (d)(3), and amends § 324.21 by revising paragraph (b). \n",
      "\n",
      "The main focus of the changes is on the capital ratio requirements and buffers for FDIC-supervised institutions subject to subpart E of this part. The amendments include, but are not limited to, revising the definition of total leverage exposure, specifying the calculation of the supplementary leverage ratio, and establishing the minimum capital requirements for FDIC-supervised institutions. \n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, the document makes technical corrections and updates to the terminology used throughout the sections.\n",
      "The document proposes a new method for calculating risk-based capital requirements for counterparty credit risk. The method, called the Basic Approach (BA)-CVA, is designed to be simpler and less risk-sensitive than the current Standardized Approach (SA)-CVA.\n",
      "The BA-CVA capital requirement is calculated as a weighted average of two components: Kunhedged and Khedged. Kunhedged is the risk-based capital requirement for CVA positions before recognizing the risk mitigating effect of eligible CVA hedges. Khedged is the risk-based capital requirement after recognizing such hedges.\n",
      "The weight assigned to Kunhedged is 0.65, while the weight assigned to Khedged is 0.35. This calibration is intended to ensure that the BA-CVA method is appropriately conservative relative to the SA-CVA.\n",
      "The calculation of Kunhedged involves two steps. First, the banking organization must calculate the standalone CVA capital requirement for each counterparty (SCVA). This is done by multiplying the exposure at default amount (EAD) by the supervisory risk weight for the counterparty and dividing by the alpha factor. \n",
      "The second step is to aggregate the SCVA amounts for all counterparties. This is done by taking the square root of the sum of the squared SCVA amounts for each counterparty. \n",
      "The calculation of Khedged involves three steps. First, the banking organization must calculate the capital reduction for each eligible CVA hedge. This is done by multiplying the supervisory prescribed correlation between the credit spread of the counterparty and the hedging instrument, the supervisory risk weight of the reference name of the hedging instrument, the remaining maturity of the hedging instrument, and the notional amount of the hedging instrument. \n",
      "The second step is to calculate the hedge mismatch adjustment for indirect single-name hedges. This is done by multiplying the difference between the supervisory prescribed correlation and one by the supervisory risk weight of the reference name of the hedging instrument, the remaining maturity of the hedging instrument, the notional amount of the hedging instrument, and the supervisory discount factor. \n",
      "The third step is to calculate the total amount by which index hedges of credit spread risk reduce the systematic component of the aggregate CVA risk across all counterparties. This is done by multiplying the supervisory risk weight for the index hedge, the remaining maturity of the index hedge, the notional amount of the index hedge, and the supervisory discount factor. \n",
      "The SA-CVA is an adaptation of the sensitivities-based method used in the standardized measure for market risk. The inputs to the SA-CVA calculations are sensitivities of the aggregate regulatory CVA and of the market value of all eligible CVA hedges under SA-CVA to delta and vega risk factors specified in the proposal. \n",
      "In general, the proposed SA-CVA would closely follow the sensitivities-based method for market risk with some exceptions. Broadly, the SA-CVA calculation would reflect capital requirements for only delta and vega (but not curvature), apply slightly different steps in the calculation of the risk-weighted net sensitivity, use less granular risk factors and risk buckets, and include a capital multiplier to account for model risk.\n",
      "The proposal revises the definition of market risk covered positions to better align with those positions the agencies believe should be subject to the market risk capital requirements as well as to reflect other proposed changes to the framework (for example, to incorporate the proposed treatment of internal risk transfers). \n",
      "\n",
      "The proposal would retain the structure and major elements of the existing definition of covered position (re-designated as “market risk covered position\") with several modifications intended to better align the definition of market risk covered position with those positions the agencies believe should be subject to the market risk capital requirements as well as to reflect other proposed changes to the framework (for example, to incorporate the proposed treatment of internal risk transfers). \n",

      "For operational risk, the risk-weighted asset amount is determined based on the bank's business indicator and internal loss multiplier. The business indicator is a measure of the bank's size and complexity, while the internal loss multiplier is a measure of the bank's historical operational losses.\n",

      "Under the proposal, the standardized measure for market risk would consist of three main components: a sensitivities-based method, a standardized default risk capital requirement, and a residual risk add-on. The sensitivities-based capital requirement would capture non-default market risk based on the estimated losses produced by risk factor sensitivities under regulatory determined stressed conditions. The standardized default risk capital requirement captures losses on credit and equity positions in the event of obligor default, while the residual risk add-on serves to produce a simple, conservative capital requirement for any other known risks that are not already captured by first two components (sensitivities-based measure and the standardized default risk capital).\n",
      "The proposal would eliminate the use of models for credit risk under the current capital rule and replace certain methodologies for recognizing the risk-reducing benefits of financial collateral and eligible guarantees and credit derivatives—namely, the internal models methodology, simple VaR approach, PD substitution approach, LGD adjustment approach, and double default treatment with the standardized approaches described below. \n",
      "\n",
      "For eligible guarantees and eligible credit derivatives, the proposal would permit banking organizations to use the substitution approach from subpart D of the current capital rule with a modification for eligible credit derivatives that do not include restructuring as a credit event. Further, the proposal would no longer permit the recognition of credit protection from nth-to-default credit derivatives. For all collateralized transactions, the corporate issuer of any financial collateral in the form of a corporate debt security must have an outstanding publicly traded security or the corporate issuer must be controlled by a company that has an outstanding publicly traded security in order to be recognized. \n",

      "\n",
      "Under the collateral haircut approach, the proposed exposure amount for an individual eligible margin loan or repo-style transaction that is not part of a netting set would yield the same result as the exposure amount equation in the current capital rule.
