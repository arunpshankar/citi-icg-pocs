The calculation of average annual total net operational losses would be based on an average of ten years of data and  a $20,000 net loss threshold  for inclusion of an operational loss in the calculation. The proposal also clarifies the boundary between operational risk and credit risk, and revises the FR Y-14Q report accordingly.\n",

The proposed equity risk buckets are intended to reflect differences in the extent to which equity prices in varying sectors are affected by the business cycle.  For small market capitalization issuers, volatility is more attributable to whether the trading position is related to an emerging market economy or liquid market economy, regardless of the sector.

The models-based measure is the sum of the non-default risk capital requirement, the potential future exposure add-on, the specific add-on, and the fallback capital requirement. Banking organizations must also have a process for valuing market risk covered positions, assessing their overall capital adequacy, and conducting due diligence on securitization positions.\n",
      "The proposal revises the calculation of the stress capital buffer requirement for large banking organizations, and applies the same stress capital buffer requirement to a banking organization's risk-based capital ratios regardless of whether they are determined using the standardized or expanded risk-based approach. \n",
      "Additionally, the proposal would amend the Board's stress testing and capital plan rules to require banking organizations subject to Category I, II, or III standards to project their risk-based capital ratios in their company-run stress tests and capital plans using the calculation approach that results in the binding ratios as of the start of the projection horizon (generally, as of December 31 of a given year). \n",
      "The proposal also requires banking organizations subject to Category IV standards to project their risk-based capital ratios under baseline conditions in their capital plans and FR Y-14A submissions using the risk-weighted assets calculation approach that results in the binding ratios as of the start of the projection horizon. \n",
      "The Board invites comment on the appropriate level of risk capture for the risk-weighted assets framework and the stress capital buffer requirement, both for their respective roles in the capital framework and for their joint determination of overall capital requirements. \n",
      "The Board also requests comment on the advantages and disadvantages of applying the same stress capital buffer requirement to a banking organization's risk-based capital ratios regardless of whether they are determined using the standardized or expanded risk-based approach, and the advantages and disadvantages of applying different stress capital buffer requirements for each set of risk-based capital ratios. \n",
      "Finally, the Board seeks comment on any adjustments that should be considered with respect to the buffer requirements to account for the transitions in this proposal, particularly related to expanded total risk-weighted assets.\n",
      "The document proposes a new capital rule for banking organizations. The rule would replace the current risk-based capital rule and would be more risk-sensitive. The proposal would introduce a number of changes to the way that banking organizations calculate their risk-weighted assets, including:\n",
      "- A new definition of retail exposure\n",
      "- A new risk-weight multiplier for certain retail and residential mortgage exposures with currency mismatch\n",
      "- A new definition of corporate exposure\n",
      "- A new risk weight for corporate exposures that are investment grade and have publicly traded securities outstanding\n",
      "- A new risk weight for corporate exposures that are not publicly traded but are \"highly regulated\"\n",
      "- A new risk weight for corporate exposures that are small or medium-sized\n",
      "This document describes the market risk capital requirements for banking organizations. The capital requirements are based on the stressed expected shortfall (SES) of the banking organization's trading portfolio. The SES is calculated using a 12-month period of stress for all non-modellable risk factors in the same risk factor class. The banking organization must also calculate an aggregate capital measure for modellable risk factors, IMCC, which is the weighted average of the constrained and unconstrained ES-based measures. The banking organization must make timely public reports and disclosures each calendar quarter.\n",
      "The proposed rule contains revisions to current information collections subject to the PRA. \n",
      "The revisions include: \n",
      "1. Reporting, Recordkeeping, and Disclosure Requirements Associated with Regulatory Capital Rules \n",
      "2. Reporting, Recordkeeping, and Disclosure Requirements Associated with Market Risk Capital Rules \n",
      "3. Financial Statements for Holding Companies \n",
      "4. Capital Assessments and Stress Testing \n",
      "5. Systemic Risk Report \n",
      "6. Consolidated Reports of Condition and Income \n",
      "7. Regulatory Capital Reporting for Institutions Subject to the Advanced Capital Adequacy Framework \n",
      "8. Market Risk Regulatory Report for Institutions Subject to the Market Risk Capital Rule \n",
      "\n",
      "The agencies are seeking comments on the proposed revisions, including whether the collections of information are necessary for the proper performance of the agencies' functions, the accuracy of the agencies' estimates of the burden of the information collections, ways to enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the information to be collected, ways to minimize the burden of the information collections on respondents, and estimates of capital or start-up costs and costs of operation, maintenance, and purchase of services to provide information.\n",
      "\n",
      "This rule implements the final rule on capital requirements for bank holding companies and savings and loan holding companies issued by the Federal Reserve Board (\"FRB\"). \n",
      "The final rule implements the capital requirements for bank holding companies and savings and loan holding companies issued by the FRB. \n",
      "The final rule amends the FRB's capital rule (the \"capital rule\") to implement the Basel III capital framework. \n",
      "The Basel III capital framework is a set of international standards developed by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (the \"Basel Committee\") in response to the financial crisis of 2008. \n",
      "The Basel III capital framework is designed to strengthen the capital requirements for banks and to make the banking system more resilient to financial shocks. \n",
      "The final rule implements the Basel III capital framework by making a number of changes to the capital rule. \n",
      "These changes include: \n",
      "increasing the minimum common equity tier 1 capital ratio from 4.5% to 4.5%; \n",
      "increasing the minimum tier 1 capital ratio from 6% to 6.5%; \n",
      "increasing the minimum total capital ratio from 8% to 8.5%; and \n",
      "implementing a new countercyclical capital buffer. \n",
      "The final rule also makes a number of changes to the capital rule that are not related to the Basel III capital framework. \n",
      "These changes include: \n",
      "removing the separate capital requirements for advanced approaches banking organizations; \n",
      "revising the definition of \"qualifying central counterparty\"; and \n",
      "making a number of technical corrections.\n",
      "The proposal introduces a new method, called the Basic CVA (BA-CVA), for calculating risk-based capital requirements for CVA risk. \n",
      "Under the proposal, the risk-based capital requirement under the BA-CVA would be calculated according to the following formula:\n",
      "\n",
      "Kbasic = 0.65 * (B * Kunhedged + (1 - B) * Khedged)\n",
      "where:\n",
      "\n",
      "Kbasic is the risk-based capital requirement under the BA-CVA;\n",
      "Kunhedged is the risk-based capital requirement for CVA positions before recognizing the risk mitigating effect of eligible CVA hedges;\n",
      "Khedged is the risk-based capital requirement after recognizing such hedges;\n",
      "B is a regulatory parameter set to 0.25.\n",
      "\n",
      "The formula sets the capital requirement under the BA-CVA equal to the weighted average of Kunhedged and Khedged, scaled by a factor of 0.65 in order to ensure that the simpler and less risk-sensitive BA-CVA method is calibrated appropriately relative to the SA-CVA.\n",
      "The Federal Reserve Board, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (collectively, the agencies) are proposing to amend the capital rule to revise the framework for calculating risk-weighted assets for market risk. \n",
      "\n",
      "The proposal would introduce a risk-sensitive standardized methodology for calculating risk-weighted assets for market risk and a new models-based methodology to replace the framework in subpart F of the current capital rule. \n",
      "\n",
      "The standardized measure for market risk would be the default methodology for calculating market risk capital requirements for all banking organizations subject to market risk requirements. \n",
      "\n",
      "A banking organization would be required to obtain prior approval from its primary Federal supervisor to use the models-based measure for market risk to determine its market risk capital requirements. \n",
      "\n",
      "The proposal would improve the current capital rule's models-based measure for market risk by replacing the VaR-based measure of market risk with an expected shortfall-based measure that better accounts for extreme losses. \n",
      "\n",
      "The proposal would also replace the fixed ten-business-day liquidity horizon in the current capital rule with liquidity horizons that vary based on the underlying risk factors to adequately capture the market risk of less liquid positions.\n",
      "The document proposes a methodology to calculate curvature risk-weighted sensitivity for market risk covered positions. \n",
      "The proposal defines risk buckets and corresponding risk weights for each risk factor. \n",
      "The risk-weighted sensitivity is calculated by multiplying the net sensitivity for each risk factor by the risk weight prescribed for each risk bucket. \n",
      "The proposal also includes provisions for calculating curvature risk-weighted sensitivity for the commodity risk class, credit spread risk, foreign exchange risk, and equity risk.\n",
      "The proposal specifies the capital treatment of internal CVA risk transfers between a CVA desk and a trading desk to hedge CVA risk arising from exposures that are subject to the proposed capital requirements for CVA risk. \n",
      "\n",
      "Under the proposal, an internal CVA risk transfer would involve two perfectly offsetting positions of a derivative transaction executed between a CVA desk and a trading desk. For the CVA desk to recognize the risk mitigation benefits of the internal risk transfer under the risk-based capital requirements for CVA risk, the proposal would require the banking organization to have a dedicated CVA desk or the functional equivalent thereof that, along with other functions performed by the desk, manages internal risk transfers of CVA risk. \n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, the proposal would require a banking organization to maintain an internal written record of each internal derivative transaction executed between the CVA desk and the trading desk, including identifying the underlying exposure being hedged by the CVA desk and the sources of such risk. Furthermore, if the internal risk transfer from the CVA desk to the trading desk is subject to curvature risk, default risk, or the residual risk add-on under the proposed market risk capital rule, the trading desk would have to execute an external transaction with a third party that is identical in its terms to the risk transferred by the CVA desk to the trading desk. \n",
      "\n",
      "For eligible internal risk transfers of CVA risk, the banking organization would be required to treat the transfers of risk from the CVA desk or the functional equivalent to the trading desk as market risk covered positions. In this way, the proposal would allow the CVA desk to recognize the risk-mitigating benefit of the hedge position received from the trading desk when calculating risk-based capital requirements for CVA risk. \n",
      "\n",
      "For transactions that do not meet these requirements or the general hedge eligibility requirements under the basic approach for CVA risk or the standardized approach for CVA risk, a banking organization would be required to include both the trading desk segment and the CVA segment of the internal transfer of CVA risk in market risk-weighted assets. This is equivalent to disregarding the internal CVA risk transfer. The entire amount of the external matching transaction executed by the non-CVA trading desk in the context of an internal CVA risk transfer would be deemed a market risk covered position. In addition, the CVA desk would not be able to recognize any risk mitigation or offsetting benefit from the ineligible internal risk transfer in its capital requirements for CVA risk.\n",
      "The proposal requires banking organizations to calculate the market risk capital requirement for equity positions in an investment fund using the look-through approach. \n",
      "For equity positions in an investment fund for which the banking organization applies the hypothetical portfolio approach or the fall back method, a banking organization would have to assume that the fund invests in exposure types with the highest applicable risk weights to the maximum extent permitted by the fund’s mandate. \n",
      "For equity positions in publicly traded real estate investment trusts that are non-securitization debt or equity positions, the proposal would require a banking organization to treat the exposures as a single exposure. \n",
      "The proposal only allows a banking organization to use the internal models approach for equity positions in an investment fund for which the banking organization is able to identify the underlying positions held by the fund on a quarterly basis. \n",
      "The proposal similarly would permit a banking organization to include term repo-style transactions in market risk covered positions, where the transactions are marked to market and provided that it includes all of such term repo-style transactions in market risk covered positions consistently over time. \n",
      "The proposal does not change the requirements under subpart F regarding public disclosure policy and attestation, the frequency of required disclosures, the location of disclosures, or the treatment of proprietary and confidential information.\n",
