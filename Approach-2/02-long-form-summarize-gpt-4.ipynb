      "Summary:\n",
      "\n",
      "I. Credit Risk Mitigation:\n",
      "A banking organization can recognize the credit risk mitigation benefits of an eligible guarantee or credit derivative by substituting the risk weight associated with the protection provider for the risk weight assigned to an exposure. This applies to exposures fully covered by an eligible guarantee or credit derivative, or covered on a pro rata basis, and to exposures with tranching of credit risk. \n",
      "\n",
      "II. Risk-Weighted Asset Calculation:\n",
      "If multiple eligible guarantees or credit derivatives cover a single exposure, the banking organization can treat the hedged exposure as multiple separate exposures and calculate a separate risk-weighted asset amount for each. Adjustments must be made for maturity mismatch and currency mismatch.\n",
      "\n",
      "III. Financial Collateral:\n",
      "To recognize the risk-mitigating effects of financial collateral, a banking organization may use the simple approach for non-derivative exposures or the collateral haircut approach for repo-style transactions, eligible margin loans, or a netting set of such transactions.\n",
      "\n",
      "IV. Securitization:\n",
      "A banking organization that transfers exposures it has originated or purchased to a securitization SPE or other third party in connection with a traditional securitization may exclude the exposures from the calculation of its risk-weighted assets only if certain conditions are met.\n",
      "\n",
      "V. Default Derivatives:\n",
      "For default derivatives, the n-1 assets with the lowest risk-weighted amounts can be excluded from the risk-weighted capital calculation. However, a banking organization cannot recognize a purchased nth-to-default credit derivative as a credit risk mitigant and must calculate the counterparty credit risk accordingly.\n",
      "\n",
      "VI. Equity Exposures:\n",
      "Banking organizations must use specific approaches to calculate risk-weighted asset amounts for equity exposures that are not in investment funds, and for other equity exposures. Different risk weights are assigned to different types of exposures.\n",
      "\n",
      "VII. Operational Risk:\n",
      "The risk-weighted assets for operational risk equals the operational risk capital requirement multiplied by 12.5. The operational risk capital requirement equals the Business Indicator Component multiplied by the Internal Loss Multiplier.\n",
      "\n",
      "VIII. Disclosure Requirements:\n",
      "Banking organizations are required to disclose their credit risk mitigation strategies, their objectives, risks, roles, and policies regarding securitization, their accounting policies for securitization activities, their equity risk for equities not subject to subpart F, and their operational risk management policies.\n",

      "\n",
      "X. Market Risk Capital Requirement:\n",
      "A banking organization's non-default risk capital requirement is calculated using the internally modelled capital calculation (IMCC) and the stressed expected shortfall (SES), with a capital multiplier of 1.5 unless otherwise specified. The standardized approach capital requirement is defined for market risk covered positions and term repo-style transactions that the banking organization includes in market risk on all trading desks, model-ineligible trading desks, and model-eligible trading desks.\n",

      "**Section 1: Proposed Rule Change and Basel Committee Reforms**\n",
      "The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, along with the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, have proposed a rule change to revise capital requirements for large banking organizations and those with significant trading activity. The changes aim to improve risk-based capital requirement calculations, reduce complexity, enhance consistency, and facilitate more effective supervisory and market assessments of capital adequacy. The revisions include replacing current requirements that use banking organizations' internal models for credit risk and operational risk with standardized approaches. The changes would align with international capital standards issued by the Basel Committee, known as the Basel III reforms, but would also reflect specific characteristics of U.S. markets and legal requirements.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Section 2: GSIB Surcharge Calculation, Systemic Risk Report, and Capital Conservation Buffer Requirement**\n",
      "The Board is proposing a revision to the GSIB surcharge calculation and systemic risk report for large banking organizations. The proposal would eliminate the use of internal models for setting credit and operational risk capital requirements for banking organizations subject to Category I or II capital standards. Instead, standardized requirements would be used, improving consistency, transparency, and efficiency. The proposal also aims to extend the application of the countercyclical capital buffer to banking organizations subject to Category IV capital standards. This tool increases capital requirements for large banks during periods of elevated risk, enhancing the resilience of the financial system. Banking organizations with over $100 billion in total consolidated assets are subject to a standardized approach capital conservation buffer requirement. The Board is proposing to amend its capital plan rule to take into account capital ratios calculated under the expanded risk-based approach, in addition to the standardized approach.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Section 3: Credit Risk Exposure, Retail Exposures, and Corporate Exposures**\n",
      "The proposal suggests that banking organizations should maintain capital in line with the level and nature of their risk exposure. It proposes replacing the use of internal models for setting regulatory capital requirements for credit risk with a new expanded risk-based approach. This approach would apply the same risk-weight treatment for on-balance sheet exposures, including those to sovereigns, certain supranational entities, and multilateral development banks. The proposal also aims to increase the credit risk-sensitivity of capital requirements for retail exposures by assigning risk weights that vary based on product type and portfolio diversification. The new definition of retail exposure includes exposure to individuals or small to medium-sized entities (SMEs), benefiting smaller companies with characteristics more akin to individuals than larger corporations. Corporate exposure under the proposal is an exposure to a company that does not fall under any other exposure category. The proposal differentiates the risk weights of corporate exposures based on factors such as credit risk, investment quality, level of subordination, and the nature of the lending arrangement.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Section 4: Project Finance Exposures, Collateral and Credit Risk Mitigants, and Haircuts for Investment Grade Senior Securitization Exposures**\n",
      "The proposal defines a project finance exposure as a corporate exposure where the banking organization relies on the revenues generated by a single project for repayment and security. The primary determinant of credit risk is the variability of the project's cash flows. Banks can reduce credit risk and associated capital requirements by using collateral and other credit risk mitigants. These mitigants must be of high quality to effectively reduce credit risk. The proposal would eliminate the use of models for credit risk under the current capital rule and replace them with standardized approaches. The proposal outlines term-based haircuts for investment grade senior securitization exposures with a risk weight of less than 100 percent. Other securitization exposures would receive a 30 percent market price volatility haircut. The proposal also includes a framework for minimum haircuts on non-centrally cleared securities financing transactions to reflect the risk exposure of banking organizations to non-bank financial entities.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Section 5: In-Scope Transactions and Minimum Haircut Floors, New Treatments and Modifications, and Securitization Exposures**\n",
      "The proposal suggests excluding certain in-scope transactions from the minimum haircut floors due to their lower credit and liquidity risks. It establishes minimum haircut floors for these transactions based on historical price volatilities and existing market conventions. If a banking organization's portfolio doesn't meet the minimum haircut floor, it cannot recognize the risk-mitigating benefits of the collateral received. The proposal introduces new treatments for default credit derivatives, derivative contracts without credit enhancement, overlapping exposures, and non-performing loan securitizations. It also modifies treatments for certain senior securitization exposures and credit-enhancing interest only strips. The proposal introduces a risk weight floor of 15 percent for securitization exposures that are not resecuritization exposures. It also proposes a minimum risk-weight floor of 100 percent for resecuritization exposures and Non-Performing Loan (NPL) securitization exposures.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Section 6: Equity Exposures, Investment Fund Exposures, Operational Risk, and Market Risk**\n",
      "The proposal maintains the current capital rule's methods for calculating the adjusted carrying value for equity exposures, with some modifications. It introduces a risk-weighted asset amount for an equity exposure and revises the risk weights applicable to other types of equity exposures. The proposal requires banking organizations to calculate a risk-weighted asset amount for each exposure held by an investment fund. If the organization cannot use the full look-through approach, it must use the alternative modified look-through approach. The proposal introduces a standardized approach for operational risk, replacing the Advanced Measurement Approaches (AMA). The new approach calculates operational risk capital requirements based on a banking organization's business indicator component and internal loss multiplier. The proposal introduces a risk-sensitive standardized methodology for calculating risk-weighted assets for market risk and a new models-based methodology. It also expands the types of positions that would be covered by market risk, including certain equity positions in an investment fund, net short risk positions, certain publicly traded equity positions, embedded derivatives on instruments issued by the banking organization, and certain positions associated with internal risk transfer.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Section 7: Internal Risk Transfers, Internal Credit Valuation Adjustment (CVA) Risk Transfers, and Market Risk Covered Positions**\n",
      "The proposal defines internal risk transfers and establishes a set of requirements for a banking organization to recognize certain types of internal risk transfers in risk-based capital requirements. It also considers modifying the criteria for including external CVA hedges in the scope of market risk covered position. The proposal outlines capital treatment for internal CVA risk transfers between a CVA desk and a trading desk. It mandates a dedicated CVA desk for managing internal risk transfers and record-keeping of each internal derivative transaction. If the internal risk transfer involves curvature risk, default risk, or the residual risk add-on, an external transaction with a third party is required. The proposal expands requirements for banking organizations to identify market risk covered positions, including annual updates and exclusions. It introduces a formal framework for re-designating a position after initial designation, requiring senior management approval.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Section 8: Trading Desk Definition and Requirements, Market Risk Capital Framework, and Documentation and Operational Requirements**\n",
      "The proposal introduces the concept of a trading desk, a unit that manages and operates trading activities. It requires clearly defined trading and hedging strategies, approved by senior management, and specifies the expected holding period, market risk, and risk acceptance level. The proposed market risk capital framework applies to all banking organizations. It requires clear policies for managing market risk, daily monitoring of position limits, and quarterly stress tests at both entity-wide and trading-des\n"
