The proposal would introduce a new framework for risk-weighting regulatory residential real estate exposures and regulatory commercial real estate exposures. 

The proposed framework is based on loan-to-value (LTV) ratios and dependency upon cash flows generated by the real estate. 

The proposal also includes a definition of defaulted real estate exposure and introduces new criteria for determining when a residential mortgage exposure or a non-residential mortgage exposure is in default.
