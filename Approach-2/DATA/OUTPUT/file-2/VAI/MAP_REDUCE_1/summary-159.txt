 -Vega capital requirement: 
 -Vega risk weights for Equity and Commodity risk are 77.78% and 100% respectively. 
 -For calculating risk weighted sensitivities for vega risk, a [BANKING ORGANIZATION] must use the corresponding risk weight for each risk class specified in Table 11 of this section.
-Vega correlation parameters: 
 -For interest rate risk, where tenor is a dimension of the risk factor, correlation parameter rkl equals: Pkl = min((option maturity)kl, (underlying maturity)kl, 1)
 -For the risk classes of credit spread risk for non-securitization positions and credit spread risk for correlation trading positions, the vega risk correlation parameter, Pkl equals the corresponding delta correlation parameter, Pkl as specified in paragraphs (b)(2)(iii)(A)(1) and (b)(3)(iii)(A)(1) of this section, respectively.
-Curvature capital requirement: 
 -For calculating the net curvature risk position CVRk, as described in ยง __.206(d)(1), for the risk classes of foreign exchange risk and equity risk, the curvature risk weight that represents a shock to risk factor k is a
