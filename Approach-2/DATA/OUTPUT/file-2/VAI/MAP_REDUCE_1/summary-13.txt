 1. The proposal requires banking organizations to use LTV ratios to assign a risk weight to regulatory residential or regulatory commercial real estate exposures. 
2. The LTV ratio would be calculated as the extension of credit divided by the value of the property. 
3. The value of the property would be the value at the time of origination of all real estate properties securing or being improved by the extension of credit. 
4. For exposures not subject to the appraisal rule, the proposal would require that the market value of real estate be obtained from an independent valuation of the property using prudently conservative valuation criteria. 
5. Under the proposal, a banking organization would assign a risk weight to a regulatory residential real estate exposure based on the exposure's LTV ratio and whether the exposure is dependent on the cash flows generated by the real estate.
