 - The proposal introduces PLA test metrics, which are intended to support sound risk management by assessing the correlation and similarity between the daily risk-theoretical profit and loss and the hypothetical profit and loss for a model-eligible trading desk. 


-  The PLA test metrics include the Spearman correlation coefficient and the Kolmogorov-Smirnov metric.


-  Banking organizations are required to allocate each model-eligible trading desk to a PLA test zone based on the results of the PLA tests.


-  The PLA add-on is calculated as the greater of zero and the aggregate capital benefit to the banking organization from the internal models approach, multiplied by a multiplication factor of k.


-  The value of k gradually increases from 0 to 0.5 as the number of model-eligible trading desks within the amber zone increases.
