 - Key points related to curvature risk position calculation:
  - The curvature capital requirement is calculated for each market risk covered position.
  - Upward and downward shocks are applied to the risk factor to determine the net curvature risk position.
  - The delta sensitivity is used to calculate the curvature risk position.
  - The curvature bucket-level risk position is calculated by aggregating the net curvature risk positions within the bucket.
  - The curvature capital requirement is calculated by aggregating the curvature bucket-level risk positions across buckets within each risk class.
  - Three different values of the correlation parameters are used to calculate the delta capital requirement, the vega capital requirement, and the curvature capital requirement.
- Key points related to sensitivities-based capital requirement:
  - Delta sensitivities, vega sensitivities, and curvature scenarios are calculated to determine the capital requirement.
  - Delta sensitivities are calculated based on the change in the value of a market risk covered position as a result of applying a specified shift to each risk factor.
  - Vega sensitivities are calculated based on the change in the value of a market risk covered position as a result of applying a specified shift to the volatility of the underlying risk factor.
  - Curvature scenarios are calculated based on the change in
