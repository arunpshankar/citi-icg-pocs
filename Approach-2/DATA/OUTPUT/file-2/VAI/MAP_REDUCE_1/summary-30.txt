 - The proposal introduces a new approach to risk-weighting securitization exposures, referred to as the "look-through approach".
- Under the look-through approach, the risk weight of a senior securitization exposure would be the lower of the risk weight calculated under the SEC-SA and 100%.
- The proposal also includes a 15% floor on the total risk-based capital requirement for securitization exposures under the look-through approach.
- The proposal would require a banking organization to deduct from common equity tier 1 capital any portion of a CEIO strip that does not constitute an after-tax gain-on-sale.
- The proposal defines an NPL securitization as a securitization whose underlying exposures consist solely of loans where parameter W for the underlying pool is greater than or equal to 90% at the origination cut-off date.
- The proposal introduces a specific approach for NPL securitization exposures as the proposed SEC-SA may be inappropriate for the unique risks of such exposures.
- Under the proposal, the nonrefundable purchase price discount would equal the difference between the outstanding balance of the underlying exposures and the price at which these exposures are sold by the originator to investors
