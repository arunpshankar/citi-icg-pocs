 1. The proposal introduces a standardized approach to calculate the default risk capital requirement for correlation trading positions. 

2. The gross default exposure is measured as the position's market value, and the net default exposure is calculated by offsetting long and short exposures in specific cases. 

3. Risk buckets are defined by index, and a bespoke correlation trading position is assigned to its own unique bucket unless it is substantially similar to an index instrument. 

4. The risk weights corresponding to the proposed risk buckets are based on the treatment under either subpart D or subpart E of the capital rule. 

5. A residual risk add-on capital requirement is proposed to capture exotic risks and other residual risks not fully reflected in the sensitivities-based capital requirement or the standardized default risk capital requirement.
