 - Significant level of dependence between exposure and counterparty's credit quality - account for dependence in regulatory CVA calculations.
- For margined counterparties, only financial collateral that qualifies for inclusion in the net independent collateral amount or variation margin amount may be recognized as a risk mitigant.
- Simulated paths of discounted future exposure must capture effects of margining collateral and relevant contractual features.
- Obtain simulated paths using same CVA exposure models used for financial reporting, adjusted to meet requirements.
- CVA delta and vega sensitivities calculated in accordance with specified requirements.
