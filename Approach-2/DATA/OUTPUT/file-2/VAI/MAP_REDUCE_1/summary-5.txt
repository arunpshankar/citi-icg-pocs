 - The stress capital buffer requirement integrates the results of the Board's supervisory stress tests with the risk-based requirements of the capital rule to determine capital distribution limitations.
- The stress capital buffer requirement is generally calculated as (1) the difference between the banking organization's starting and minimum projected common equity tier 1 capital ratios under the severely adverse scenario in the supervisory stress test (stress test losses) plus (2) the sum of the dollar amount of the banking organization's planned common stock dividends for each of the fourth through seventh quarters of the planning horizon as a percentage of risk-weighted assets (dividend add-on).
- The proposal would amend the Board's stress testing and capital plan rules to require banking organizations subject to Category I, II, or III standards to project their risk-based capital ratios in their company-run stress tests and capital plans using the calculation approach that results in the binding ratios as of the start of the projection horizon (generally, as of December 31 of a given year).
- The proposal would also require banking organizations subject to Category IV standards to project their risk-based capital ratios under baseline conditions in their capital plans and FR Y-14A submissions using the risk-weighted assets calculation approach that results in the
