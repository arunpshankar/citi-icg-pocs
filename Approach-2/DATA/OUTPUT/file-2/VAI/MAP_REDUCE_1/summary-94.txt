 - The proposal requires banking organizations to separately calculate risk-based capital requirements for delta and vega using the specified steps.
- A banking organization should always measure the sensitivity of regulatory CVA to vega risk factors, regardless of whether the CVA risk covered positions include positions with optionality.
- The proposal specifies risk classes for delta and vega risk factors related to expected exposure under SA-CVA, which are generally consistent with those under the sensitivities-based method for market risk.
- For credit spread risk, the proposal specifies two distinct risk classes: counterparty credit spread risk and reference credit spread risk.
- Vega risk factor sensitivities of the aggregate regulatory CVA, in addition to delta risk factor sensitivities, should be computed for each of the five exposure-related risk classes, regardless of whether the portfolio includes options.
- The proposal specifies the sensitivity calculations for delta and vega risk factors.
- For CVA risk covered positions or eligible CVA hedges referencing an index, the proposal requires calculating sensitivities to all risk factors upon which the value of the index depends.
- The SA-CVA allows introducing a set of additional risk factors that directly correspond to qualified credit and equity indices for counterparty credit spread risk, reference credit spread risk, and equity risk.
