 * The proposal establishes minimum haircut floors for in-scope transactions, which are transactions involving an unregulated financial institution where the banking organization lends cash, or securities, or borrows cash or securities. 


*  The haircut floors are intended to reflect the minimum amount of collateral banking organizations should receive when undertaking in-scope transactions with unregulated financial institutions. 


*  The proposal would require a banking organization to compare the haircut (H) and a single-transaction or portfolio haircut floor (f) to determine whether an in-scope transaction or a netting set of in-scope transactions meets the relevant floor. 


*  If H is less than f, then the banking organization may not recognize the risk-mitigating effects of any financial collateral that secures the exposure. 


*  The proposal includes a detailed description of how to calculate H and f for single cash-lent-for-security in-scope transactions, single security-for-security repo-style transactions, and netting sets of in-scope transactions.
