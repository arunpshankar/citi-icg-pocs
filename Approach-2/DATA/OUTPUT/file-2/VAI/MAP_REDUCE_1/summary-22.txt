 1. The proposal requires banking organizations to recognize the full effective notional amount of credit derivatives that do not include restructuring as a credit event, if certain conditions are met. 

2. The exemption from the 40 percent haircut is not overly broad because it is limited to credit derivatives that provide protection similar to credit derivatives that include restructuring as a credit event. 

3. The proposed treatment of eligible credit derivatives that do not include restructuring of the reference exposure as a credit event is relevant outside of the United States because it would ensure that such derivatives are recognized in a consistent manner across jurisdictions. 

4. The proposal would only allow a banking organization to recognize the risk-mitigating benefits of a corporate debt security that meets the definition of financial collateral in expanded risk-weighted assets if the corporate issuer of the debt security has a publicly traded security outstanding or is controlled by a company that has a publicly traded security outstanding. 

5. The proposal would retain the simple approach of the current capital rule, including restrictions on collateral eligibility and the risk-weight floor, except for the proposed requirement for certain corporate debt securities.
