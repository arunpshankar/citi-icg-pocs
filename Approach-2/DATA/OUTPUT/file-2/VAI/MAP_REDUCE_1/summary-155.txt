 - For purposes of aggregating risk-weighted delta sensitivities of interest rate risk within a bucket, a [BANKING ORGANIZATION] must use the specified correlation parameters.

- For credit spread risk for non-securitizations, a [BANKING ORGANIZATION] must establish buckets along two dimensions, credit quality and sector.

- For calculating risk weighted delta sensitivities for credit spread risk for non-securitizations, a [BANKING ORGANIZATION] must use the risk weights in Table 3 of this section.
