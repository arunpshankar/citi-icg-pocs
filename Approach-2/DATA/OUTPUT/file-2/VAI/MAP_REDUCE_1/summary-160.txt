 - The standardized default risk capital requirement must be calculated for:
  - Non-securitization debt or equity positions (other than U.S. sovereign positions or MDBs)
  - Securitization positions non-CTP
  - Correlation trading positions
- The calculation involves assigning each default risk position to a prescribed bucket, calculating gross default exposure, calculating obligor-level net default exposure (with scaling for maturities less than one year), calculating a hedge benefit ratio, assigning risk weights to obligor-level net default exposures, and generating bucket-level default risk capital requirements.
- The standardized default risk capital requirement for non-securitization debt and equity positions or securitization positions non-CTP equals the sum of the bucket-level default risk capital requirements. 
- The standardized default risk capital requirement for correlation trading positions must be calculated in accordance with the aggregation formula in paragraph (d)(3)(v) of this section.
