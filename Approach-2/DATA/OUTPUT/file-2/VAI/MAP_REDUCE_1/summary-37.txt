 Key points of the proposal:

* The proposal introduces a standardized approach for operational risk capital requirements, replacing the advanced measurement approaches (AMA).
* The standardized approach uses a business indicator component and an internal loss multiplier to determine the operational risk capital requirement.
* The business indicator component is a measure of the operational risk exposure of the banking organization and is calculated based on its business indicator multiplied by scaling factors that increase with the business indicator.
* The internal loss multiplier is based on the ratio of a banking organization's historical operational losses to its business indicator component and increases the operational risk capital requirement as historical operational losses increase.
* The proposal also includes a minimum internal loss multiplier of one to ensure the robustness of the operational risk capital requirement.
