 1. The proposal introduces a new framework for risk-weighting retail exposures, which includes a 35% risk weight for exposures to retail obligors that meet certain criteria. 

2. The proposal also includes a 1.5x multiplier for certain retail and residential mortgage exposures with currency mismatch. 

3. Corporate exposures are differentiated based on credit risk, with risk weights ranging from 65% to 150%. 

4. A 65% risk weight is assigned to corporate exposures that are investment grade and have publicly traded securities outstanding. 

5. The proposal requests feedback on alternative criteria for identifying corporate exposures that would warrant a risk weight of 65% or a risk weight between 65% and 100%.
