 **Advantages of the proposed methodology:**

- Captures baseline exposure of a netting set of eligible margin loans or repo-style transactions after accounting for the value of any collateral.
- Allows the formula to recognize netting at the level of the netting set and correlations in the movement of market prices for instruments lent and received.
- The contribution from the gross exposure component to the exposure amount would decrease proportionally with an increase in the number of unique instruments by CUSIP designations or foreign equivalent, capturing the impact of portfolio diversification.
- The fourth component would capture any adjustment to reflect currency mismatch, if applicable.

**Disadvantages of the proposed methodology:**

- The complexity of the formula may make it difficult for some banking organizations to implement.
- The haircuts used in the formula may not be appropriate for all types of collateral.
- The formula does not take into account the credit risk of the counterparty.

**Advantages of an alternative method to calculate the number of instruments N based on the number of legal entities that issued or guaranteed the instruments:**

- Simpler to implement than the proposed methodology.
- Would take into account the credit risk of the counterparty.
