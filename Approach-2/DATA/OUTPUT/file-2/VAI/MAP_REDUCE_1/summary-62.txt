 - The proposal would require a banking organization to calculate the delta sensitivity for positions with optionality using either the sticky strike rule, the sticky delta rule, or, with prior approval from its primary Federal supervisor, another assumption.
- For market risk covered positions with optionality, the vega sensitivity to a risk factor would equal the vega of an option multiplied by the volatility of the option.
- The vega capital requirement would only apply to options or instruments with embedded optionality, including instruments with material prepayment risk.
- Callable and puttable bonds that are priced based on the yield to maturity of the instrument would not be subject to the vega capital requirement.
- The proposal would require a banking organization to assign options to buckets based on their maturity and the maturity of the option's underlying instrument.
- The agencies seek comment on the merits of allowing banking organizations to ignore the optionality of callable and puttable bonds that are priced using yield-to-maturity of the instrument if the option is not exercised relative to the merits of specifying a value for implied volatility (for example, 35 percent) to be used in calculating the vega capital requirement for credit spread risk positions when the implied volatility cannot be measured or is not readily available in the market.
