 - The sensitivities-based method for market risk proposed by the agencies captures the risks of positions subject to the market risk capital requirement by mapping market risk covered positions to specified risk factors and calculating capital requirements for delta, vega, and curvature. 
- The proposed risk factors differ for each risk class to reflect the specific market risk variables relevant for each risk class. 
- For risk classes that include specific tenors or maturities as risk factors, the proposal would require a banking organization to assign the risk factors to the proposed tenors through linear interpolation or a method that is most consistent with the pricing functions used by the internal risk management models. 
- The sensitivities-based method could be further improved by considering additional features such as the potential for risk factor correlations to increase or decrease in periods of stress, and by making adjustments to the treatment of diversification of risks.
