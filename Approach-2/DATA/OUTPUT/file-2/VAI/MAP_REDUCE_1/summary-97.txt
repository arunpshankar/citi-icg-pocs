 - The agencies propose to use prescribed aggregation formulas to produce respective delta and vega risk capital requirements for CVA risk.
- For each risk bucket b, a banking organization would aggregate all net weighted sensitivities for all risk factors within this risk bucket.
- A banking organization would aggregate bucket-level capital requirements across risk buckets within the same risk class.
- The overall risk-based capital requirement for CVA risk would be the simple sum of the separately calculated risk-class-level delta and vega capital requirements across risk classes without any recognition of any diversification benefits.
- The agencies propose a three-year transition period for two provisions of the proposal: the expanded risk-based approach and, for banking organizations subject to Category III or IV capital standards, the AOCI regulatory capital adjustments.
- A banking organization's expanded total risk-weighted assets would be phased-in starting July 1, 2025, until June 30, 2028.
- From July 1, 2025 until June 30, 2028, for a banking organization subject to Category III or IV capital standards, the aggregate amount of net unrealized gains or losses on AFS debt securities and HTM securities included in
