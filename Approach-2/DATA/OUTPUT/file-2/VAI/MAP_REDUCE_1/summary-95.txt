 Key points of the article:

* The SA-CVA is an alternative to the sensitivities-based method for calculating CVA risk.
* The SA-CVA uses a simpler approach to calculating CVA risk by defining risk factors in a much less granular way.
* The SA-CVA defines risk buckets for delta and vega risk factors by sector and credit quality for counterparty credit spread risk, reference credit spread risk, and equity risk.
* The SA-CVA defines risk buckets for delta and vega risk factors matching the risk buckets for commodity risk in the proposed sensitivities-based method for market risk.
* The SA-CVA uses the same bucket structure and risk weights as the sensitivities-based method for market risk for exposure-related risk classes.
