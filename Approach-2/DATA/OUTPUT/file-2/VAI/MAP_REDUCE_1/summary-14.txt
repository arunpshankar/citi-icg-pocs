 - The proposal introduces a new framework for risk-weighting regulatory residential real estate exposures and regulatory commercial real estate exposures.
- The proposed framework is based on loan-to-value (LTV) ratios and dependency upon cash flows generated by the real estate.
- The proposal also includes a definition of defaulted real estate exposure and introduces new criteria for determining when a residential mortgage exposure or a non-residential mortgage exposure is in default.
- The agencies seek comment on the impact of the proposed treatment on home affordability and home ownership opportunities, particularly for LMI borrowers or other historically underserved markets.
- The agencies also seek comment on assigning risk weights to residential mortgage exposures, consistent with the current U.S. standardized risk-based capital framework.
- The agencies seek comment on the potential market effects of the proposed treatment on residential and commercial real estate mortgage lending.
