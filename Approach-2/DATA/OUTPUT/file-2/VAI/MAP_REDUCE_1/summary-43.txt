 **Key points related to proposed rule on risk-based capital requirements for banking organizations**

* The agencies are proposing a new risk-based capital framework for banking organizations that would replace the current framework.
* The new framework would be based on the Basel III capital framework, which was developed by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS).
* The new framework would make significant changes to the way that banking organizations calculate their risk-based capital requirements.
* The new framework would be more risk-sensitive than the current framework, meaning that banking organizations would be required to hold more capital for riskier activities.
* The new framework would also be more countercyclical, meaning that banking organizations would be required to hold more capital during periods of economic stress.
* The agencies are also proposing a number of changes to the risk-based capital framework for banking organizations that are not based on the Basel III framework.
* These changes include a new requirement for banking organizations to hold capital for operational risk, a new requirement for banking organizations to hold capital for credit valuation adjustment (CVA) risk, and a new requirement for banking organizations to hold capital for market risk.
