Exposure amount for derivative contracts is determined using the standardized approach for counterparty credit risk (SA-CCR). 

For credit derivatives, if the derivative is recognized as a credit risk mitigant for an exposure that is not a market risk covered position, no separate counterparty credit risk capital requirement is required. 

For equity derivatives, the contract is treated as an equity exposure and a risk-weighted asset amount is computed. If the contract is also treated as a market risk covered position, a risk-based capital requirement for the counterparty credit risk must also be calculated. 

The exposure amount of a netting set is equal to 1.4 multiplied by the sum of the replacement cost and the potential future exposure of the netting set. 

There are certain exceptions to the exposure amount calculation for netting sets subject to variation margin agreements, fully paid options, and commercial end-users.
