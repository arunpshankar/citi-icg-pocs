 1. The SA-CVA would assign one delta (and, separately, one vega) risk factor per risk bucket for the foreign exchange, reference credit spread, equity, and commodity risk classes.


2. For the interest rate risk class, the SA-CVA would have two groups of risk buckets/currencies: the "specified" currencies (USD, EUR, GBP, AUD, CAD, SEK, and JPY) and the other currencies.


3. The risk weights for counterparty credit spread risk factors under the SA-CVA would exactly match those for reference credit spread delta risk factors.


4. The proposal would merge the investment grade bucket and speculative and sub-speculative grade bucket of each sector into a single bucket for the counterparty credit spread risk class.


5. The agencies propose to set the cross-bucket correlations, YÃ»c, equal to the corresponding correlations that would be applicable under the assumption of the same credit quality in the non-securitization credit spread risk class in the sensitivities-based method for market risk.
