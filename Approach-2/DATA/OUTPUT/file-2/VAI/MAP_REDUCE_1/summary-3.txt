 Key Points:

* The proposal would remove the use of internal models to set credit risk and operational risk capital requirements for banking organizations subject to Category I or II capital standards.


* The proposal would continue to allow use of internal models to set market risk capital requirements for portfolios where modeling can be demonstrated to be appropriate.


* The proposal's expanded risk-based approach would apply to banking organizations with total assets of $100 billion or more and their subsidiary depository institutions.


* Banking organizations with significant trading activities are subject to substantial market risk and, therefore, would be subject to market risk capital requirements.


* The proposal would increase the dollar-based threshold for the application of market risk requirements from $1 billion to $5 billion of trading assets plus trading liabilities.
