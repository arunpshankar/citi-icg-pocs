 - The proposal revises the definition of "attachment point" and introduces the concept of
"detachment point" to provide greater clarity on the capital treatment of securitization
exposures.
- Attachment point means the percentage of the total principal balance of the underlying
exposures at which the credit risk of the securitization exposure begins to increase.
- Detachment point means the percentage of the total principal balance of the underlying
exposures at which the credit risk of the securitization exposure is fully detached from the
credit risk of the underlying exposures.
- The detachment point is a new concept that is intended to provide greater clarity on the
point at which a securitization exposure is no longer exposed to the credit risk of the
underlying exposures.
b. Subordinated tranches
- The proposal revises the capital treatment of subordinated tranches of securitization
exposures.
- Under the current capital rule, subordinated tranches of securitization exposures are
assigned a risk weight of 1,250 percent.
- The proposal would assign a risk weight of 1,250 percent to subordinated tranches of
securitization exposures that are not rated by an external credit assessment institution.
- The
