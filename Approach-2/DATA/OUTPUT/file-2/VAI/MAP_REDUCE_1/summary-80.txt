 - A lower capital multiplier (mc) would be applied to the 60-day average estimated capital required for modellable risk factors, based on the number of exceptions in the entity-wide backtesting results.


- The proposed backtesting requirements would measure the conservatism of the forecasting assumptions and the valuation methods in the expected shortfall models used for determining risk-based capital requirements.


- A high number of exceptions could indicate modeling issues and warrant increased capital requirements.


- The proposed PLA add-on would require a banking organization's market risk capital requirement to reflect an additional capital requirement for deficiencies in the accuracy of a banking organization's internal models.


- The PLA test would require a banking organization to compare the daily profit and loss values produced by its internal risk management models (risk-theoretical profit and loss) against the hypothetical profit and loss produced by the front office models.


- The proposal would allow, subject to approval by the primary Federal supervisor, a banking organization, for a model-eligible trading desk that holds a limited amount of securitization positions or correlation trading positions pursuant to its trading or hedging strategy, to include such positions for the purposes of the PLA tests.
