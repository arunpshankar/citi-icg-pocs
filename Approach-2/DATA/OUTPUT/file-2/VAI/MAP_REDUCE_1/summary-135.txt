 - A [BANKING ORGANIZATION] must calculate its annual total net operational loss for each year by adding:
  - The total net operational losses for each quarter of the year; and
  - The total net operational losses for each quarter of the preceding year that are associated with operational loss events whose accounting impacts extend into the current year.


- The total net operational losses for a quarter equal the sum of any portions of losses or recoveries of any material operational losses allocated to the quarter.


- A material operational loss is an operational loss incurred by the [BANKING ORGANIZATION] that resulted in a net loss greater than or equal to $20,000 after taking into account all subsequent recoveries related to the operational loss.
