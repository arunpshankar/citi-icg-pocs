 - The proposed correlation parameters closely follow those in the Basel III reforms, calibrated to capture market correlations observed over a long time horizon that included a period of stress based on empirical data.
- For securitization positions non-CTP, the proposal would require a banking organization to consider the name (in the case of non-securitization positions and correlation trading positions) and tranche (in the case of securitization positions non-CTP) to determine the applicable correlation parameters for risk factors within the same risk bucket when calculating the aggregate risk bucket level capital requirements for delta and vega.
- In the case of credit spread risk for securitization positions non-CTP, the agencies generally are proposing to require a 100 percent intra-bucket correlation parameter for securitization positions in the same bucket and related to the same securitization tranche with more than 80 percent overlap in notional terms and a 40 percent intra-bucket correlation parameter otherwise.
- For risk factors allocated to the "other sector" bucket within the credit spread and equity risk classes, the risk bucket level capital requirement would equal the sum of the absolute values of the risk-weighted sensitivities for both the delta capital requirement and the vega capital requirement (no correlation parameters would apply to
