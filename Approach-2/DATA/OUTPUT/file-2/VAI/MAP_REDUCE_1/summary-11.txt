 Key points related to the definition of a subordinated debt instrument, including preferred stock that is not an equity exposure, and any tier 2 instrument or covered debt instrument that is not deducted from regulatory capital: 

* The proposal includes subordinated debt instruments and any preferred stock that is not an equity exposure in the definition. 


* The proposal also includes any tier 2 instrument or covered debt instrument that is not deducted from regulatory capital, including TLAC debt instruments, and any debt instrument that would otherwise be treated as regulatory capital by the primary federal supervisor of the issuer and that is not deducted from regulatory capital.


* The proposal generally would apply a 150 percent risk weight for exposures that meet the definition of a subordinated debt instrument.


* The instruments included in the scope of subordinated debt instruments present a greater risk of loss to an investing banking organization relative to more senior debt exposures to the same issuer because subordinated debt instruments have a lower priority of repayment in the event of default.
