 Key points:

- The proposal introduces a standardized approach for calculating risk-based capital requirements for index hedges and CVA risk.
- For index hedges, the proposal assigns risk weights based on the constituents of the index and applies a diversification factor.
- For CVA risk, the proposal uses a sensitivities-based method with some modifications, including reduced granularity of risk factors and a capital multiplier to account for model risk.
- The proposal defines regulatory CVA as an estimate of the market expectation of future loss in the event of a counterparty's default.
- The calculation of regulatory CVA requires inputs such as the term structure of market-implied PD, market-consensus ELGD, and simulated paths of discounted future exposure.
- The proposal allows the use of proxies to estimate the term structure of market-implied PD for illiquid counterparties.
- The proposal generally requires the use of the same market-consensus ELGD as the one used in calculations of the market-implied PD from the credit spreads.
