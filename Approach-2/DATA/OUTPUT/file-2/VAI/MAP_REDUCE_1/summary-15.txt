 Key points related to Real Estate Exposures under the advanced approaches
- The proposal defines defaulted real estate exposure as (1) 90 days or more past due or in nonaccrual status; (2) where the banking organization has taken a partial charge-off, write-down of principal, or negative fair value adjustment on the exposure for credit-related reasons; or (3) where the banking organization agreed to a distressed restructuring.
- A defaulted real estate exposure that is a residential mortgage exposure not dependent on the cash flows generated by the real estate would receive a risk weight of 100 percent.
- Any other defaulted real estate exposure would receive a risk weight of 150 percent.
- ADC exposures that are not HVCRE exposures would be assigned a 100 percent risk weight.
- Other real estate exposures would be assigned a 150 percent risk weight, unless the exposure is a residential mortgage exposure that is not dependent on the cash flows generated by the real estate, which must be assigned a 100 percent risk weight.
