 - The proposal retains the structure and major elements of the existing definition of "covered position" with several modifications. 
  - Expands the definition to explicitly include trading assets and trading liabilities held for the purpose of regular dealing or making a market in securities or other instruments. 
  - Includes certain positions or hedges of such positions regardless of whether the position is a trading asset or trading liability, including foreign exchange and commodity positions. 
  - Excludes structural positions in a foreign currency and foreign exchange and commodity positions that are part of a customer-related transaction. 
  - Clarifies that positions that are free of restrictive covenants on their tradability or for which the material risk elements may be hedged by the banking organization in a two-way market are included. 
  - Specifies that correlation trading positions and instruments resulting from securities underwriting commitments are included, but excludes purchases that are held to maturity or available for sale purposes.
