-	Total net operational losses would include operational losses in the quarter in which their accounting impacts were recorded, rather than aggregated into a single event date. 
-	Recoveries would be included in the quarter in which they are paid to the banking organization. 
-	The proposal's definition of operational loss includes a clarification regarding the boundary between operational risk and credit risk.
