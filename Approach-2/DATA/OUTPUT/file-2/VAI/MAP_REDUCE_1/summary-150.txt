 - To calculate sensitivities-based capital requirement, a [BANKING ORGANIZATION] must apply an upward and downward shock to each risk factor and calculate the incremental loss in excess of that already captured by the delta capital requirement.
- For each risk class, a [BANKING ORGANIZATION] must calculate the delta capital requirement, the vega capital requirement and the curvature capital requirement.
- The sensitivities-based capital requirement equals the largest capital requirement produced under the three correlation scenarios.
- The delta capital requirement is calculated by aggregating the risk-weighted delta sensitivities across risk factors with common characteristics.
- The vega capital requirement is calculated by aggregating the risk-weighted vega sensitivities across risk factors with common characteristics.
- The curvature capital requirement is calculated by applying an upward shock and a downward shock to each risk factor and calculate the incremental loss in excess of that already captured by the delta capital requirement.
