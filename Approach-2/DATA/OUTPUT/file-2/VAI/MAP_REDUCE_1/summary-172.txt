Where,
(i) The correlation parameter, p, is defined in paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section;
(ii) Σc( ) refers to a summation across all counterparties, c, of CVA risk covered
positions, SCVAČ, as defined in paragraph (a)(2)(iii) of this section;
(iii) SNH is calculated as follows:

Where,
(A) Σhec() refers to a summation across all single-name eligible CVA hedges, h, that
the [BANKING ORGANIZATION] uses to hedge the CVA risk of counterparty, c;
(B) The is the correlation between the credit spread of counterparty, c, and the credit
spread of a single-name hedge, h, of counterparty, c,
