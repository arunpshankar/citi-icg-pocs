 Key points:

- The proposal defines defaulted exposures and outlines the criteria for determining when an exposure is in default.

- A defaulted exposure would be assigned a 150 percent risk weight to reflect the increased uncertainty as to the recovery of the remaining carrying value.

- The proposal provides three categories for bank exposures: Grade A, Grade B, and Grade C, with Grade A being the highest in terms of creditworthiness.

- The proposal would assign a 20 percent risk weight to GSE exposures that are not equity exposures, securitization exposures, or exposures to a subordinated debt instrument issued by a GSE.

- The proposal would apply the same 20 percent risk weight to all exposures to FHLB or Farmer Mac, including equity exposures and exposures to subordinated debt instruments.

- The proposal defines the scope of exposures to depository institutions, foreign banks, and credit unions in a manner that is consistent with the definitions and scope of exposures covered under the current capital rule.
