 1. For credit spread risk for securitization positions non-CTP, a [BANKING ORGANIZATION] must establish buckets along two dimensions, credit quality and sector.
2. For calculating risk weighted delta sensitivities for credit spread risk for securitization positions non-CTP, a [BANKING ORGANIZATION] must use the risk weights in Table 7 of this section.
3. For purposes of aggregating risk weighted delta sensitivities of credit spread risk for securitization positions non-CTP within a bucket as specified in § _.206(b)(2), a [BANKING ORGANIZATION] must use the following correlation parameters:
- For buckets 1 through 24, the correlation parameter Pk between risk weighted delta sensitivities WS and WS₁, equals:
(tenor)
(basis)
Pkl
(tranche)
Pkl
=
× Pkl
× Pkl
where,
(1) Pkl
(tranche)
equals 100 percent where the two delta sensitivities to risk factors k and l
are within the same bucket and related to the same tranche, with more than 80 percent overlap in
notional terms and 40 percent otherwise;
(2) Pkl
(tenor
