 - The proposal includes a table of supervisory risk weights for different sectors and credit
qualities of counterparties. The agencies request comment on the appropriateness of these
risk weights, particularly for financials, including government-backed financials.
- The agencies request comment on the appropriateness of treating the counterparty credit
risks of public-sector entities and the GSEs in the same way as those of government-backed
non-financials, education, and public administration.
- The agencies propose to apply a 0.65 calibration factor in the formula setting the capital
requirement under the BA-CVA to ensure that CVA risk capital requirements
appropriately reflect CVA risk. The agencies request comment on this calibration factor
and whether other levels should be considered.
- The agencies propose to use the counterparty credit risk framework to calculate the
exposure amount for standalone CVA counterparty-level capital requirement. The
agencies request comment on this approach and whether it poses particular issues in the
case of nonfinancial counterparties.
- The agencies propose a formula for calculating the risk-based capital requirements for
CVA risk after recognizing the risk mitigation benefits of eligible counterparty credit
spread hedges. The agencies request comment on this formula and its components.
