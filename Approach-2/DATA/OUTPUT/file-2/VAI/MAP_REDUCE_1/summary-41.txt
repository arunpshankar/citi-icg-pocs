 Key Points:

* The proposal includes a formula for calculating annual total net operational losses for merged or acquired entities for missing years.


* The internal loss multiplier would equal one in cases where the number of years of loss data meeting the internal loss event data collection requirements is less than five years.


* Banking organizations would be able to request supervisory approval to exclude operational loss events that are no longer relevant to their risk profile from the internal loss multiplier calculation.


* The agencies would only consider providing supervisory approval for exclusions after operational losses have been included in a banking organization's total net operational losses for at least three years.


* Banking organizations would continue to be required to collect operational loss event data.


* The proposal would introduce a requirement that banking organizations collect descriptive information about the drivers or causes of operational loss events that result in a gross operational loss of $20,000 or more.


* The proposal would not include certain data requirements included in the AMA, such as estimating operational risk exposure, collecting external operational loss event data, scenario analysis, and business, environment, and internal control factors.
