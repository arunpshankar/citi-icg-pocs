 **Key Points**

- Project finance exposures:
 - Proposal defines project finance exposure as a corporate exposure where the banking organization relies on revenues from a single project as the source of repayment and security for the loan. 
 - Project finance exposure would receive a 130% risk weight during pre-operational phase and 100% risk weight during operational phase. 
 - Clarification on the differentiation between project finance exposures and exposures secured by real estate is requested. 


- Off-balance sheet exposures:
 - Proposal introduces updated credit conversion factors to calculate exposure amount for off-balance sheet items. 
 - Credit conversion factors range from 10% to 100%, reflecting the expected proportion of the off-balance sheet item that would become an on-balance sheet credit exposure. 
 - Commitments with no express contractual maximum amount or pre-set limit would be calculated using an averaging formula over the previous two years. 
 - Off-balance sheet exposure amount would be multiplied by applicable risk weight to determine risk-weighted asset amount.
