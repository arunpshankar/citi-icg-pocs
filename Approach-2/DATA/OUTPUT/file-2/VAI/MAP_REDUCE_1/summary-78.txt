 Key Points:
* The proposal introduces a standardized approach for determining risk factor categories and corresponding liquidity horizons.
* Liquidity horizon-adjusted expected shortfall-based measure is calculated at entity-wide level for each risk class and across risk classes.
* The calculation considers potential losses over different liquidity horizons and assigns longer horizons to certain risk factors.
* The proposal provides a formula for calculating the liquidity horizon-adjusted expected shortfall-based measure.
* The stress period is determined based on a twelve-month period of stress that results in the largest cumulative loss for market risk covered positions.
* The stress period is reviewed and updated quarterly or when there are material changes in risk factors.
