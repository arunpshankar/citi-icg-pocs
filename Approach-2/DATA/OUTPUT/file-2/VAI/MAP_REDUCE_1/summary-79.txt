 - The agencies propose to require banking organizations to use the same reduced set of risk factors to identify the appropriate stress period and calculate the IMCCs. 


- The proposal would require a banking organization to use a stress scenario that is calibrated to be at least as prudent as the expected shortfall-based measure for modellable risk factors and calculate the liquidity horizon-adjusted expected shortfall-based measure for non-modellable risk factors in stress using the same general process as proposed for modellable risk factors, with three key differences. 


- The proposal would allow a banking organization to use proxies in designing the stress scenario for each risk class of non-modellable risk factors, as long as such proxies satisfy the data quality requirements for modellable risk factors. 


- The proposal generally would retain the backtesting requirements in subpart F of the current capital rule, with two modifications. 


- The agencies seek comment on the appropriateness of requiring banking organizations to use the same reduced set of risk factors to both identify the appropriate stress period and calculate the IMCCs. 


- The agencies seek comment on the treatment of non-modellable risk factors, specifically whether it is appropriate and commensurate with their risks. 


- The agencies seek comment on whether they should consider scaling the
