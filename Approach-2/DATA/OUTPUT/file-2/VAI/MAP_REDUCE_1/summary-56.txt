 - The agencies are proposing a standardized measure for calculating market risk capital requirements and a new methodology for the internal models approach. 
- A banking organization with model-eligible trading desks would calculate market risk capital requirements under both the standardized and models-based measures. 
- The standardized measure for market risk would consist of three main components: sensitivities-based method, standardized default risk capital requirement, and residual risk add-on. 
- The agencies view the proposed standardized measure for market risk as sufficiently risk sensitive to serve as a credible floor to the models-based measure for market risk. 
- The primary Federal supervisor may require a banking organization to calculate capital requirements for specific positions under either subpart D or E instead of under subpart F, or under subpart F instead of under subpart D or E, or under both subpart F and subpart D or E, as applicable. 
- The primary Federal supervisor may require a banking organization to modify its observation period or methodology used to measure market risk, when calculating the expected shortfall measure or stressed expected shortfall.
