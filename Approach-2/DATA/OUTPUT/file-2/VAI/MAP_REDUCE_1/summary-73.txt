 1. The proposal requires banking organizations to identify an appropriate set of risk factors that is sufficiently representative of the risks inherent in all of the market risk covered positions held by model-eligible trading desks.
2. The proposal would require a banking organization's expected shortfall models to include all the applicable risk factors specified in the sensitivities-based method under the standardized approach, with one exception, as well as those used in either the banking organization's internal risk management models or in the internal valuation models it uses to report actual profits and losses for financial reporting purposes.
3. For a risk factor to be classified as a modellable risk factor, a banking organization would be required to identify a sufficient number of real prices that are representative of the risk factor (those that could be used to infer the value of the risk factor).
4. The proposal defines a real price as a price at which the banking organization has executed a transaction, a verifiable price for an actual transaction between third parties transacting at arm's length, or a price obtained from a committed quote made by the banking organization itself or another party, subject to certain conditions.
5. The proposal would limit recognition of prices obtained from third-party providers to prices (1) from a transaction or committed quote
