 1. The IMCC for modellable risk factors is intended to capture potential losses from market risk covered positions on model-eligible trading desks during substantial market stress. 


2. The proposal requires daily calculation of an expected shortfall-based measure for each risk class and across risk classes under stressed market conditions. 


3. Expected shortfall internal models must satisfy backtesting and PLA testing requirements, capture risks associated with options, and appropriately model the volatility surface. 


4. A banking organization may exclude non-modellable risk factors from expected shortfall-based internal models with approval from its primary Federal supervisor. 


5. The proposal allows the use of either the full set of modellable risk factors or an appropriate subset to estimate potential losses throughout a twelve-month stress period.
