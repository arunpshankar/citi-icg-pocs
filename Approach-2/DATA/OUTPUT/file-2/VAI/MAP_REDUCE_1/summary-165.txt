 - A backtesting framework for market risk models used by banking organizations to calculate their capital requirements.
- Backtesting involves comparing the model's hypothetical profit and loss (PnL) with the actual PnL over a certain period.
- If the model fails the backtesting, it is deemed model-ineligible and subject to higher capital requirements.
- Trading desks are also subject to a desk-level backtesting requirement called the PLA test, which compares the hypothetical PnL with the risk-theoretical PnL.
- The PLA test results determine the trading desk's PLA test zone, which can be green, amber, or red.
- If either metric is in the red zone, the PLA test zone is red. If one metric is in the amber zone and one in the green zone, the PLA test zone is amber.
