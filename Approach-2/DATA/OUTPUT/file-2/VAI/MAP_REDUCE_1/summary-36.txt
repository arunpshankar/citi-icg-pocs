 Key points of the article:

* The proposal would introduce a capital requirement for operational risk based on a standardized approach.
* The current capital rule defines operational risk as the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people, and systems, or from external events.
* Operational risk includes legal risk but excludes strategic and reputational risk.
* Experience shows that operational risk is inherent in all banking products, activities, processes, and systems.
* Under the current capital rule, banking organizations subject to Category I or II capital standards are required to calculate risk-weighted assets for operational risk using the advanced measurement approach (AMA).
* The proposal would replace the AMA with the standardized approach for operational risk.
* The standardized approach would be based on a formula that uses a combination of factors, including the banking organization's gross income, total assets, and number of employees.
* The proposal would also require banking organizations to hold a capital buffer for operational risk.
* The capital buffer would be based on the banking organization's risk profile and would be designed to absorb losses from operational risk events.
