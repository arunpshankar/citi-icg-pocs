- The proposal allows banking organizations to elect to use either the direct or indirect approach to apply to the entire portfolio of modellable risk factors for market risk covered positions on model-eligible trading desks.
- The proposal specifies liquidity horizons for various risk factors, with longer horizons assigned to those that would require longer periods of time to sell or hedge.
- The proposal requires banking organizations to establish and document procedures for performing risk factor mappings consistently over time.
