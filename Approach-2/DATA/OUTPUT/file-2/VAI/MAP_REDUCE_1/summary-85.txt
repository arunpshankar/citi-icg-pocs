 The proposal eliminates existing quantitative disclosures for calculating risk-based capital requirements, but retains existing quantitative disclosures related to securitizations and adds a new quantitative disclosure requiring a comparison of VaR-based estimates to actual gains or losses. 

The proposal revises existing qualitative disclosures for material portfolios and adds new qualitative disclosures related to a banking organization's processes and policies for managing market risk. 

In addition to public disclosure requirements, the proposal requires a banking organization to provide a quarterly public regulatory report of its measure for market risk and submit confidential supervisory reports containing backtesting and PLA testing data. 

The proposal streamlines the definitions related to securitizations in subpart F with those in subparts D and E of the capital rule. 

The proposal also makes technical amendments to the market risk rule to conform to the revisions made to the standardized approach in the Basel III framework.
