 1. The proposal introduces a 40 percent conversion factor for conditional commitments to acquire an equity exposure, replacing the current differentiation of conversion factors by maturity.

2. The adjusted carrying value of an equity exposure is calculated as the effective notional principal amount multiplied by the conversion factor, minus the adjusted carrying value of the on-balance sheet component.

3. Under the expanded simple risk-weight approach (ESRWA), the risk-weighted asset amount for an equity exposure (except for equity exposures to investment funds) is determined by multiplying the adjusted carrying value by the applicable risk weight.

4. The proposal revises the risk weights for various types of equity exposures, including introducing a 1,250 percent risk weight for certain equity exposures to investment firms with greater than immaterial leverage.

5. Community development investments and small business investment companies are assigned a 100 percent risk weight under the proposal, recognizing their favorable risk-return structure and importance in promoting public welfare goals.
