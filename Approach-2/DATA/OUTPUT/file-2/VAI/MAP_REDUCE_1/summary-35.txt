 - The proposal generally maintains the risk-weight treatment provided under the alternative modified look-through approach in the advanced approaches of the current capital rule, with five exceptions.
- The proposal would require banking organizations to include off-balance sheet transactions, counterparty credit risk, and CVA risk when calculating the total risk-weighted asset amount for the investment fund.
- The proposal would require a banking organization to adjust the average risk weight for its equity exposure to the investment fund upwards by the ratio of the total assets of the investment fund to the total equity of the investment fund.
- The proposal would cap the risk weight applicable to an equity exposure to an investment fund under the alternative modified look-through approach at no more than 1,250 percent.
- The proposal would floor the minimum risk weight that may be assigned to the adjusted carrying value of any equity exposure to an investment fund under the proposed look-through approaches at 20 percent.
- If a banking organization does not have the necessary information to apply the full look-through approach or the alternative modified look-through approach, the proposal would require the banking organization to assign a 1,250 percent risk weight to the adjusted carrying value of its equity exposure to the investment fund.
