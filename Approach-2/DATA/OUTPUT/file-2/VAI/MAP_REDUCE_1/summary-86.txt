 - The CVA risk capital requirements would apply to large banking organizations and their subsidiary depository institutions subject to Category I standards, and to large banking organizations subject to Category II, III or IV standards. 


- The proposal would provide two measures for calculating CVA risk capital requirements: (1) the basic measure for CVA risk which includes the basic CVA approach (BA-CVA) capital requirement, which recognizes only the credit spread component of CVA risk and is similar to the current capital rule's simple CVA approach, and (2) a standardized measure for CVA risk which includes a new standardized CVA approach (SA-CVA) capital requirement and the basic CVA approach capital requirement. 


- The SA-CVA would account for both credit spread and exposure components of CVA risk and would allow a banking organization to recognize hedges for the exposure component of CVA risk. 


- The proposal would require a banking organization to receive a prior approval from the primary federal supervisor to calculate the CVA risk capital requirements under the standardized measure for CVA risk.
