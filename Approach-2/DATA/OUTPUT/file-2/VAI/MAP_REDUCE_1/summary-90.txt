 - The proposal introduces a new method, the Basic CVA (BA-CVA), for calculating risk-based capital requirements for CVA risk. 
- The BA-CVA capital requirement is calculated as a weighted average of the risk-based capital requirement for CVA positions before and after recognizing the risk mitigating effect of eligible CVA hedges. 
- The weights are 0.25 and 0.75, respectively. 
- The formula for calculating the risk-based capital requirement under the BA-CVA is Kbasic = 0.65 (ẞ Kunhedged + (1 - ẞ) Khedged), where Kbasic is the risk-based capital requirement under the BA-CVA; Kunhedged is the risk-based capital requirement for CVA positions before recognizing the risk mitigating effect of eligible CVA hedges; Khedged is the risk-based capital requirement after recognizing such hedges; and  is a regulatory parameter set to 0.25.
- The Kunhedged formula is intended to reflect the potential losses arising from unhedged CVA risk. 
- The proposal would set the exposure at default amount, EADNs, for the netting set, NS, equal to the
