 - The CVA delta capital requirement is calculated separately for each currency.
- For specified currencies, there are five delta risk factors for interest rate risk: absolute changes in inflation rate and risk-free yields for 1, 2, 5, 10, and 30 years.
- For currencies not specified, the delta risk factors for interest rate risk are the absolute change in inflation rate and the parallel shift of the entire risk-free yield curve.
- The delta risk weights for interest rate risk are specified in Table 1.
- The delta within-bucket correlation parameters for interest rate risk are specified in Table 2.
- The delta cross-bucket correlation parameter for interest rate risk is 50% for all currency pairs.
- For foreign exchange risk, there is a separate delta bucket for each currency, except for the reporting currency.
- The delta risk factors for foreign exchange risk are the relative change of the foreign exchange spot rate between a given currency and the reporting currency.
- The delta risk weights for foreign exchange risk are 11% for all exchange rates.
- The delta cross-bucket correlation parameter for foreign exchange risk is 60% for all currency pairs.
- For counterparty
