 - The regulation requires banking organizations to have a sound framework for managing market risk, including policies and procedures for identifying, measuring, and mitigating market risk exposures.
- The regulation specifies requirements for the calculation of the standardized measure for market risk and the models-based measure for market risk.
- The standardized measure for market risk is the sum of the sensitivities-based capital requirement, the standardized default risk capital requirement, and the residual risk add-on.
- The models-based measure for market risk is the sum of the non-default risk capital requirement, the profit and loss attribution (PLA) add-on, the stressed add-on (SA), and the fallback capital requirement.
- Banking organizations must have a rigorous process for assessing their overall capital adequacy in relation to their market risk, taking into account risks that may not be fully captured by the standardized or models-based measures for market risk.
- Banking organizations must have a comprehensive understanding of the features of securitization positions and must conduct due diligence on such positions prior to acquiring them.
- Banking organizations must adequately document all material aspects of their identification, management, and valuation of market risk covered positions, including internal risk transfers and any re-designations of their positions.
