 Key Points:
- The expanded risk-based framework generally produces greater overall risk-weighted assets than either of the current approaches.
- The most commonly binding capital requirement would shift from the current standardized approach to the expanded risk-based approach.
- The proposal would increase binding common equity tier 1 capital requirements by an estimated 16 percent for large holding companies.
- The proposal would likely result in an increase in equity capital funding maintained by large banking organizations.
- The proposal's potential impact on lending is estimated to increase risk-weighted assets (RWA) associated with banking organizations' lending activities by $380 billion.
- Increases in capital requirements in general should enhance the resilience of the banking system, supporting lending and economic activity in downturns.
