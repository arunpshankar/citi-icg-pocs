 Key points:

- The proposal would establish a minimum observation period for new issuances, which would begin on the issuance date and would be pro-rated until 12 months after the issuance date.
- For market risk covered positions that reference new reference rates, the proposal would allow the banking organization to use quotes of discontinued reference rates that the new reference rate is replacing to pass the risk factor eligibility test until the new reference rate liquidity improves.
- Once a risk factor has passed the risk factor eligibility test, the banking organization would be required to choose the most appropriate data for calculating the IMCC for modellable risk factors.
- The proposal would establish data quality requirements for risk factors to be deemed modellable risk factors.
- The proposal would require a banking organization to update the data inputs at a sufficient frequency and on at least a weekly basis.
- In determining the liquidity horizon-adjusted expected shortfall-based measure, a banking organization would be required to use data that are reflective of market prices observed or quoted in periods of stress.
- The data for modellable risk factors could include proxies if the banking organization were able to demonstrate the appropriateness of such proxies to the satisfaction of the primary Federal supervisor.
