 exposures.
Question 68: What are the potential benefits and costs of the proposed look-through
approach for senior securitization exposures? To what extent do banking organizations
anticipate using the look-through approach?
iii.
Risk-weight floors for certain exposures
The proposal would apply a risk-weight floor of 15 percent to all non-defaulted exposures
that are not resecuritization exposures and are not NPL securitization exposures. The proposal
would also apply a risk-weight floor of 20 percent to all exposures that are resecuritization
exposures but are not NPL securitization exposures. The proposal would apply a risk-weight
floor of 50 percent to all NPL securitization exposures.
Question 69: What are the potential benefits and costs of the proposed risk-weight floors
for certain exposures? To what extent do banking organizations anticipate the risk-weight
floors to affect their risk-based capital requirements?
