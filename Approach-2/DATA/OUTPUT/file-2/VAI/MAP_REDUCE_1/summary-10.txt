 1. The proposal introduces a new framework for risk-weighting bank exposures, which would replace the current framework.
2. The new framework would assign risk weights to bank exposures based on the obligor's creditworthiness, as measured by its external credit rating and publicly disclosed capital ratios.
3. The proposal would also introduce a risk weight floor for foreign bank exposures based on the risk weight applicable to a sovereign exposure for the jurisdiction where the foreign bank is incorporated.
4. The proposal would also introduce a definition and an explicit risk weight treatment for exposures in the form of subordinated debt instruments.
5. The proposal would also make a number of technical changes to the current capital rule, including clarifying the definition of a covered bond and revising the risk weights for certain exposures.
