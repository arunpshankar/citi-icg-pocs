 - A banking organization would be required to define its trading desk structure, which must define each trading desk and identify: 
  - Model-eligible trading desks 
  - Model-ineligible trading desks 
  - Trading desks for internal risk transfers 
  - Notional trading desks 
- A banking organization would need to receive prior written approval from the primary Federal supervisor of its trading desk structure. 
- The agencies would consider whether the level at which a banking organization is proposing to establish its trading desks is consistent with the level at which trading activities are actively managed and operated. 
- The agencies would also consider whether the level at which the banking organization defines each trading desk is sufficiently granular to allow the banking organization and the primary Federal supervisor to assess the adequacy of the internal models used by the trading desk. 
- The proposal would require a banking organization to have a clearly defined policy, approved by senior management, that describes the general strategy of the trading desk, the risk and position limits established for the trading desk, and the internal controls and governance structure established to oversee the risk-taking activities of the trading desk. 
- The proposal would maintain certain operational requirements for active management of market risk covered positions, stress testing, control and oversight
