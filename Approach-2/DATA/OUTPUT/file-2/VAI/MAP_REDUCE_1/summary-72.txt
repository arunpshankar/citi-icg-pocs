 - The proposal generally requires a banking organization to apply a look-through approach when calculating market risk capital requirements for index instruments and multi-underlying options. 
- For listed and well-diversified credit or equity indices, however, the proposal would allow a banking organization to treat the index as a single position and assign the sensitivity of the index to the relevant sector or index bucket based on a waterfall approach. 
- The agencies seek comment on the proposed 75 percent threshold for assigning a credit or equity index to the corresponding sector or the investment grade indices bucket, as well as any potential challenges from requiring the look-through approach for all index instruments and multi-underlying options that are non-securitization debt or equity positions for the standardized default risk capital calculation. 
- The internal models approach capital requirements for model-eligible trading desks (IMAG,A) would consist of four components: (1) the internally modelled capital calculation for modellable risk factors (IMCC); (2) the stressed expected shortfall for non-modellable risk factors (SES); (3) the standardized default risk capital requirement; and (4) the aggregate trading portfolio backtesting capital multiplier. 
- The IMCC and SES would capture risk and distinguish between risk factors
