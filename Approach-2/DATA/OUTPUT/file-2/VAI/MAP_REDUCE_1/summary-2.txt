 - The proposal would strengthen risk-based capital requirements for large banking organizations by improving their comprehensiveness and risk sensitivity.
- The proposal would eliminate the use of banking organizations' internal models to set regulatory capital requirements and in their place apply a simpler and more consistent standardized framework.
- The proposal would retain banking organizations' ability to use internal models, with an improved models-based measure for market risk that better accounts for potential losses.
- The proposal would adopt new standardized approaches for market risk and credit valuation adjustment (CVA) risk that better reflect the risks of banking organizations' exposures.
- The proposal would maintain the capital rule's dual-requirement structure, under which a large banking organization would be required to calculate its risk-based capital ratios under both the new expanded risk-based approach and the standardized approach (including market risk, as applicable), and use the lower of the two for each risk-based capital ratio.
- The proposal would align the calculation of regulatory capital for banking organizations subject to Category III or IV capital standards with the calculation for banking organizations subject to Category I or II capital standards.
- The proposal would expand application of the supplementary leverage ratio and the countercyclical capital buffer to banking organizations subject to Category IV capital standards.
