 Key points of the article:

* The agencies are proposing a new standardized measure for market risk capital requirements.
* The standardized measure would replace the current VaR-based measure with an expected shortfall measure to capture tail risk.
* The standardized measure would also replace the fixed ten business-day liquidity horizon in subpart F of the current capital rule with ones that vary based on the underlying risk factors in order to adequately capture the market risk of less liquid positions.
* The proposal also would limit the regulatory capital benefit of hedging and portfolio diversification across different asset classes, which generally dissipates in stress periods.
* The agencies are seeking comment on all aspects of the models-based measure for market risk calculation, including the capital requirement for instances where the capital requirement under the internal models approach for model-eligible desks exceeds the amount required for such desks under the standardized approach.
* The agencies are also seeking comment on the fallback capital requirement, which would apply in instances where a banking organization is not able to calculate market risk capital requirements under the standardized approach and the internal models approach, if eligible.
