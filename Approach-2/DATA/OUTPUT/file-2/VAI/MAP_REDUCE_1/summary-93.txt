 **Key points:**

- The proposal requires a banking organization to generally assume that derivative contracts' seniority is the same as the seniority of senior unsecured bonds.


- The proposal would allow a banking organization to adjust the market-consensus ELGD to appropriately reflect the lower or higher losses arising from such exposures.


- The proposal would require that these exposure models be subject to the same model calibration processes (with the exception of the margin period of risk, which would have to meet the regulatory floors), and use the same market and transaction data as the exposure models that the banking organization uses for calculating CVA for financial reporting purposes.


- The proposal would require that (1) simulated paths of discounted future exposure capture the effects of margining collateral that is recognized as a risk mitigant along each exposure path; and (2) the exposure model appropriately captures all the relevant contractual features such as the nature of the margin agreement (that is, unilateral versus bilateral), the frequency of margin calls, the type of collateral, thresholds, independent amounts, initial margins, and minimum transfer amounts.


- The proposal would require a banking organization's exposure model to assume that the counterparty will not post or return any collateral within a certain time period immediately prior to that time, known as the margin
