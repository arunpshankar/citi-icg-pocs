 1. The agencies are proposing to amend their market risk information collections to reflect the proposed recordkeeping, disclosure, and reporting requirements associated with the proposed market risk capital requirements. 


2. A banking organization subject to the proposed market risk capital requirements would have to provide public regulatory reports and receive prior written approval from its primary Federal supervisor for calculating market risk capital requirements using internal models. 


3. The proposal would also include recordkeeping requirements for banking organizations subject to the credit valuation adjustment, such as having a clear documented hedging policy for CVA risk and documenting the initial and ongoing validation of models used for calculating regulatory CVA. 


4. The Board is proposing to amend the FR Y-9C report form and instructions to align with the proposal, including revising Schedule HC-R, Part I, Regulatory Capital Components and Ratios, to align the calculation of regulatory capital for HCs subject to Category III and IV standards with the calculation for HCs subject to Category I and II standards. 


5. The Board estimates that revisions to the FR Y-9C would increase the estimated annual burden by 49 hours.
