 **Key Points - Proposed Amendments to Market Risk Information Collections**

- The agencies propose to amend market risk information collections to reflect proposed recordkeeping, disclosure, and reporting requirements associated with the proposed market risk capital requirements. 


- Banking organizations subject to the market risk capital requirements would provide public regulatory reports and receive prior written approval from their primary Federal supervisor for calculating market risk capital requirements using internal models. 


- Confidential supervisory reports, backtesting information, and PLA testing information would be submitted to the primary Federal supervisor. 


- Recordkeeping requirements for banking organizations subject to the credit valuation adjustment would include having a clear documented hedging policy, documenting identification and management of covered positions and eligible hedges, validating models used for calculating regulatory CVA, and maintaining current and historical data inputs to exposure models. 


- The FR Y-9 family of reporting forms continues to be the primary source of financial data on holding companies (HCs) on which examiners rely between on-site inspections. 


- The Board proposes to amend the FR Y-9C report form and instructions to align with the proposal, including updates to Schedule HC-R, Part I, Line item 60, a, b and c to apply the stress capital buffer requirement to the risk-based capital
