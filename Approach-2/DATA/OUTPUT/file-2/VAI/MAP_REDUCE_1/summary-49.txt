 Internal risk transfers:

- The proposal defines internal risk transfers as a transfer executed through internal derivatives trades of credit risk or interest rate risk arising from an exposure capitalized under subparts D or E of the capital rule to a trading desk, or a transfer of CVA risk arising from a CVA desk (or the functional equivalent if the banking organization does not have any CVA desks) to a trading desk.
- The proposal would require documentation and other conditions for a banking organization to recognize certain types of internal risk transfers in risk-based capital requirements.
- For internal risk transfers of credit risk, the banking organization would be required to maintain documentation identifying the underlying exposure under subpart D or E of the capital rule being hedged and its sources of credit risk. 
- For internal risk transfers of interest rate risk, the proposal would allow a banking organization to establish a dedicated notional trading desk for conducting internal risk transfers to hedge interest rate risk. 
- For internal risk transfers of CVA risk, the proposal would require the banking organization to maintain documentation identifying the underlying exposure under subpart E of the capital rule being hedged and its sources of CVA risk.
