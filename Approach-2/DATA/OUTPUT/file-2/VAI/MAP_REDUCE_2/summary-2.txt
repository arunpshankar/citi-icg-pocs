 I. Introduction
A. Overview of the Proposal
  - The proposal modifies the regulatory capital requirements for large banking organizations and those with significant trading activity. 
  - It replaces the current internal models approach for credit and operational risk with standardized approaches and revises market risk and credit valuation adjustment risk requirements. 
  - The proposal is consistent with recent changes to international capital standards issued by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision. 
B. Use of Internal Models Under the
Proposed Framework
  - The proposal generally prohibits the use of internal models to calculate risk-weighted assets for credit risk and operational risk. 
  - Standardized approaches will be used instead. 
  - The proposal permits the use of internal models to calculate market risk capital requirements and CVA risk capital requirements, subject to certain conditions. 
II. Scope of Application
  - The proposal applies to banking organizations with total assets of $100 billion or more and their subsidiary depository institutions, as well as to banking organizations with significant trading activity. 
  - The proposal would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities supervised by the Board. 
III. Proposed Changes to the Capital Rule
A. Calculation of Capital Ratios and
Application of Buffer Requirements
  1. Standardized Output Floor
     - The proposal establishes a standardized output floor of 75% for all banking organizations subject to the capital rule. 
     - This means that a banking organization's risk-weighted assets cannot be less than 75% of what they would be under the standardized approaches. 
  2. Stress Capital Buffer Requirement
     - The proposal increases the stress capital buffer requirement from 2.5% to 3.0% for banking organizations with total assets of $250 billion or more. 
     - The stress capital buffer requirement remains at 2.0% for banking organizations with total assets of less than $250 billion.

     Income

     Adjustments
     - The proposal makes a number of technical adjustments to the definition of capital, including updates to terminology, removal of expired transition provisions, and corrections to errors.
