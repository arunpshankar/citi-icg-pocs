 I. Introduction
A. Overview of the Proposal
- The proposal revises the capital requirements for large banking organizations and banking organizations with significant trading activity.
- It replaces the current requirements that include the use of banking organizations' internal models for credit risk and operational risk with standardized approaches.
- It replaces the current market risk and credit valuation adjustment risk requirements with revised approaches.
- The proposed revisions would be generally consistent with recent changes to international capital standards issued by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision.
- The proposal would not amend the capital requirements applicable to smaller, less complex banking organizations.
B. Use of Internal Models Under the
Proposed Framework
- The agencies are proposing to modify the capital requirements applicable to large banking organizations and banking organizations with significant trading activity.
- The revisions would strengthen the calculation of risk-based capital requirements to better reflect the risks of these banking organizations' exposures.
- The revisions would also enhance the consistency of requirements across large banking organizations and facilitate more effective supervisory and market assessments of capital adequacy.
- The proposal includes changes to the calculation of capital ratios and application of buffer requirements, the definition of capital, credit risk, securitization framework, equity risk, operational risk, market risk, and credit valuation adjustment risk.
- The proposal also includes transition provisions, technical amendments, and proposed amendments to related rules and related proposals.
II. Scope of Application
- The proposal would apply to banking organizations with total assets of $100 billion or more and their subsidiary depository institutions.
- Banking organizations with significant trading activities are subject to substantial market risk and, therefore, would be subject to market risk capital requirements.
- The proposal would increase the dollar-based threshold for the application of market risk requirements from $1 billion to $5 billion of trading assets plus trading liabilities.
III. Proposed Changes to the Capital Rule
A. Calculation of Capital Ratios and
Application of Buffer Requirements
1. Standardized Output Floor
- The proposal would introduce an "output floor" to the calculation of expanded total risk-weighted assets. This output floor would correspond to 72.5 percent of the sum of a banking organization's credit risk-weighted assets, equity risk-weighted assets, operational risk-weighted assets, and CVA risk-weighted assets under the expanded risk-based approach and risk-weighted assets calculated using the standardized measure for market risk.
2. Stress Capital Buffer Requirement
- The stress capital buffer requirement integrates the results of the Board's supervisory stress tests with the risk-based requirements of the capital rule to determine capital distribution limitations.
- The stress capital buffer requirement is generally calculated as (1) the difference between the banking organization's starting and minimum projected common equity tier 1 capital ratios under the severely adverse scenario in the supervisory stress test (stress test losses) plus (2) the sum of the dollar amount of the banking organization's planned common stock dividends for each of the fourth through seventh quarters of the planning horizon as a percentage of risk-weighted assets (dividend add-on).
- The proposal would amend the Board's stress testing and capital plan rules to require banking organizations subject to Category I, II, or III standards to project their risk-based capital ratios in their company-run stress tests and capital plans using the calculation approach that results in the binding ratios as of the start of the projection horizon (generally, as of December 31 of a given year).
- The proposal would also require banking organizations subject to Category IV standards to project their risk-based capital ratios under baseline conditions in their capital plans and FR Y-14A submissions using the risk-weighted assets calculation approach that results in the
B. Definition of Capital
1. Accumulated Other Comprehensive
Income
- Banking organizations subject to Category III or IV capital standards would be required to recognize most elements of AOCI in regulatory capital consistent with the treatment for banking organizations subject to Category I or II capital standards.
- This would require all net unrealized holding gains and losses on AFS debt securities from changes in fair value to flow through to common equity tier 1 capital, including those that result primarily from fluctuations in benchmark interest rates.
- Banking organizations subject to Category III or IV capital standards would also apply the capital deductions and minority interest treatments that are currently applicable to banking organizations subject to Category I or II capital standards.
- The proposal would also apply TLAC holdings deduction treatments to banking organizations subject to Category III or IV capital standards.
- The proposal includes a three-year transition period for AOCI.
2. Regulatory Capital Deductions
- Banking organizations subject to Category III or IV capital standards would be required to make deductions for nonsignificant investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions and covered debt instruments issued by U.S. or foreign GSIBs.
- The limitations on minority interests that apply to banking organizations subject to Category I or II capital standards would also apply to banking organizations subject to Category III or IV capital standards.
- An additional capital eligibility criterion would be applied to banking organizations subject to Category III or IV capital standards for their additional tier 1 and tier 2 capital instruments.
3. Additional Definition of Capital
Adjustments
- A large banking organization would determine its expanded risk-based approach-adjusted total capital by (1) deducting from its total capital AACL included in its tier 2 capital and; (2) adding to its total capital any AACL up to 1.25 percent of total credit risk-weighted assets.
- The agencies seek comment on the proposed definition of total credit risk-weighted assets in connection with determining a banking organization's total capital ratio.
4. Changes to the Definition of Tier 2
Capital Applicable to Large Banking
Organizations
- The proposal would amend the definition of tier 2 capital to exclude from tier 2 capital any amount of AACL that is included in a banking organization's total capital.
- The proposal would also make conforming changes to the definition of tier 2 capital to ensure that the definition is consistent with the definition of tier 2 capital in the Basel III framework.
C. Credit Risk
1. Due Diligence
- The proposal would require banking organizations to conduct due diligence on all exposures to identify and assess the risks associated with those exposures.
- The proposal would also require banking organizations to establish and maintain policies and procedures to ensure that the due diligence process is effective.
2. Proposed Risk Weights for Credit Risk
- The proposal introduces an expanded risk-based approach for credit risk applicable to large banking organizations.
- The proposal retains many of the same definitions from the current capital rule, including sovereign, sovereign exposure, supranational entities, multilateral development bank, public sector entity (PSE), government-sponsored enterprise (GSE), other assets, and a commitment.
- The proposal applies the same risk-weight treatment provided in the current standardized approach for on-balance sheet exposures to sovereigns, certain supranational entities and multilateral development banks, government sponsored entities (GSEs) in the form of senior debt and guaranteed exposures, Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) and Federal Agricultural Mortgage Corporation (Farmer Mac) equity exposures, 49 public sector entities (PSEs), and other assets.
- The proposal also applies the same risk-weight treatment provided in the current standardized approach to the following real estate exposures: pre-sold construction loans, statutory multifamily mortgages, and high-volatility commercial real estate (HVCRE) exposures.
- The proposal introduces the expanded risk-based approach for exposures to depository institutions, foreign banks, and credit unions; exposures to subordinated debt instruments, including those to GSEs; and exposures to residential mortgage loans.
3. Off-Balance Sheet Exposures
- The proposal would update the credit conversion factors for off-balance sheet items to reflect the current risk environment.
- The proposal would also require banking organizations to use a more conservative approach to calculating the exposure amount for certain off-balance sheet items, such as commitments.
4. Derivatives
- The proposal would make a number of changes to the capital requirements for derivatives, including:
 - Introducing a new framework for risk-weighting regulatory residential real estate exposures and regulatory commercial real estate exposures.
- The proposed framework is based on loan-to-value (LTV) ratios and dependency upon cash flows generated by the real estate.
- The proposal also includes a definition of defaulted real estate exposure and introduces new criteria for determining when a residential mortgage exposure or a non-residential mortgage exposure is in default.
- The agencies seek comment on the impact of the proposed treatment on home affordability and home ownership opportunities, particularly for LMI borrowers or other historically underserved markets.
- The agencies also seek comment on assigning risk weights to residential mortgage exposures, consistent with the current U.S. standardized risk-based capital framework.
- The agencies seek comment on the potential market effects of the proposed treatment on residential and commercial real estate mortgage lending.
E. Equity Exposures
1. Risk-Weighted Asset Amount
- The proposal would revise the risk-weighted asset amount calculation for equity exposures to investment funds.
- The proposal would also introduce a new approach for calculating the risk-weighted asset amount for equity exposures to investment funds that are not subject to the full look-through approach or the alternative modified look-through approach.
F. Operational Risk
1. Business Indicator
- The proposal would introduce a business indicator component that would be used to calculate the operational risk capital requirement.
- The business indicator would reflect the volume of financial activities of a banking organization.
2. Business Indicator Component
- The business indicator component would increase at a rate of: (a) 12 percent per unit of business indicator for levels of business indicator up to $1 billion; (b) 15 percent per unit of business indicator for levels of business indicator above $1 billion and up to $30 billion; and (c) 18 percent per unit of business indicator for levels of business indicator above $30 billion.
3. Internal Loss Multiplier
- The internal loss multiplier would be calculated as follows:
Internal Loss Multiplier
= maximum 1, In
. In (exp(1
exp(1) – 1
0.8
15 x Average Annual Total Net Operational Losses
Business Indicator Component
- Average annual total net operational losses would correspond to the average of annual
total net operational losses over the previous ten years (on a rolling quarter basis).
- The constant used is consistent with the Basel III reforms.
