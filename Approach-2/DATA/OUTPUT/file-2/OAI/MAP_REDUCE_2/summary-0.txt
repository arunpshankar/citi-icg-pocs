**Section 1: Proposed Rule Change**
The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation have proposed a rule change to revise capital requirements for large banking organizations and those with significant trading activity. The changes aim to improve risk-based capital requirement calculations, reduce complexity, enhance consistency, and facilitate more effective supervisory and market assessments of capital adequacy. The revisions include replacing current requirements that use banking organizations' internal models for credit risk and operational risk with standardized approaches.

**Section 2: Basel Committee Reforms**
The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision has proposed reforms to strengthen risk-based capital requirements for large banking organizations. The changes would align with international capital standards issued by the Basel Committee, known as the Basel III reforms, but would also reflect specific characteristics of U.S. markets and legal requirements. The proposal would eliminate the use of banking organizations' internal models to set regulatory capital requirements, replacing them with a simpler and more consistent standardized framework.

**Section 3: GSIB Surcharge Calculation and Systemic Risk Report**
The Board is proposing a revision to the GSIB surcharge calculation and systemic risk report for large banking organizations. The proposal would eliminate the use of internal models for setting credit and operational risk capital requirements for banking organizations subject to Category I or II capital standards. Instead, standardized requirements would be used, improving consistency, transparency, and efficiency.

**Section 4: Countercyclical Capital Buffer and Leverage Ratio Requirement**
The proposal aims to extend the application of the countercyclical capital buffer to banking organizations subject to Category IV capital standards. This tool increases capital requirements for large banks during periods of elevated risk, enhancing the resilience of the financial system. The proposal also expands the application of the supplementary leverage ratio requirement to banking organizations subject to Category IV capital standards.

**Section 5: Capital Conservation Buffer Requirement**
Banking organizations with over $100 billion in total consolidated assets are subject to a standardized approach capital conservation buffer requirement. The Board is proposing to amend its capital plan rule to take into account capital ratios calculated under the expanded risk-based approach, in addition to the standardized approach.

**Section 6: Credit Risk Exposure**
The proposal suggests that banking organizations should maintain capital in line with the level and nature of their risk exposure. It proposes replacing the use of internal models for setting regulatory capital requirements for credit risk with a new expanded risk-based approach. This approach would apply the same risk-weight treatment for on-balance sheet exposures, including those to sovereigns, certain supranational entities, and multilateral development banks.

**Section 7: Retail Exposures**
The proposal aims to increase the credit risk-sensitivity of capital requirements for retail exposures by assigning risk weights that vary based on product type and portfolio diversification. The new definition of retail exposure includes exposure to individuals or small to medium-sized entities (SMEs), benefiting smaller companies with characteristics more akin to individuals than larger corporations.

**Section 8: Corporate Exposures**
Corporate exposure under the proposal is an exposure to a company that does not fall under any other exposure category. The proposal differentiates the risk weights of corporate exposures based on factors such as credit risk, investment quality, level of subordination, and the nature of the lending arrangement.

**Section 9: Project Finance Exposures**
The proposal defines a project finance exposure as a corporate exposure where the banking organization relies on the revenues generated by a single project for repayment and security. The primary determinant of credit risk is the variability of the project's cash flows.

**Section 10: Collateral and Credit Risk Mitigants**
Banks can reduce credit risk and associated capital requirements by using collateral and other credit risk mitigants. These mitigants must be of high quality to effectively reduce credit risk. The proposal would eliminate the use of models for credit risk under the current capital rule and replace them with standardized approaches.

**Section 11: Haircuts for Investment Grade Senior Securitization Exposures**
The proposal outlines term-based haircuts for investment grade senior securitization exposures with a risk weight of less than 100 percent. Other securitization exposures would receive a 30 percent market price volatility haircut. The proposal also includes a framework for minimum haircuts on non-centrally cleared securities financing transactions to reflect the risk exposure of banking organizations to non-bank financial entities.
