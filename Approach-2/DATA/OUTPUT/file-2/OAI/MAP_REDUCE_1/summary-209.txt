1. The FDIC-supervised institution's carrying value for equity securities classified as available-for-sale or held-to-maturity is calculated by subtracting any net unrealized gains and adding any net unrealized losses on the exposure. This applies if the institution has made an AOCI opt-out election.
2. For off-balance sheet components of an exposure, the notional amount is multiplied by the appropriate credit conversion factor (CCF). This excludes OTC derivative contracts, repo-style transactions, eligible margin loans, cleared transactions, default fund contributions, and securitization exposures.
3. The exposure amount for OTC derivative contracts, cleared transactions, eligible margin loans or repo-style transactions, and securitization exposures is determined under specific sections of the FDIC regulations.
4. A netting set refers to a group of transactions with a single counterparty that are subject to a qualifying master netting agreement and consist of derivative contracts, repo-style transactions, or eligible margin loans.
5. The protection amount (P) for an exposure hedged by an eligible guarantee or credit derivative is the effective notional amount of the guarantee or credit derivative, reduced to reflect any currency mismatch, maturity mismatch, or lack of restructuring coverage.
