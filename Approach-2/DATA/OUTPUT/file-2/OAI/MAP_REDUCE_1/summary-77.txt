1. The proposal suggests that banking organizations should calculate the entity-wide liquidity horizon-adjusted expected shortfall-based measures for all risk factors during stress. This calculation would be based on a reduced set of risk factors and would be multiplied by the ratio of the current period's measure to the lesser of the current liquidity-horizon adjusted measure or ESF,C.
2. The proposal also requires that the reduced set of risk factors should explain at least 75% of the variability of the losses estimated by the full set of risk factors over the preceding 60 business days. This compliance would be determined based on an out-of-sample RÂ² measure.
3. The proposal mandates that banking organizations update the reduced set of risk factors whenever they update their twelve-month stress period. The reduced set of risk factors used to calculate the liquidity horizon-adjusted expected shortfall-based measure for the stress period should have a sufficiently long history of observations that satisfies the data quality requirements.
4. The proposal also seeks comments on the appropriateness of requiring the election of either the direct or the indirect approach to apply to the entire portfolio of modellable risk factors for market risk covered positions on model-eligible trading desks.
5. The proposal suggests assigning each modellable risk factor to the proposed liquidity horizons specified in
