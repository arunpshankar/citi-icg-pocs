1. For calculating risk-weighted delta sensitivities for foreign exchange risk, a banking organization must apply a risk weight of 15 percent, except for certain listed currencies where the risk weight can be divided by the square root of 2. 
2. For aggregating delta bucket-level risk positions within the foreign exchange risk class, the cross-bucket correlation parameter equals 60 percent. 
3. For calculating risk-weighted sensitivities for vega risk, a banking organization must use the corresponding risk weight for each risk class as specified in Table 11. 
4. For purposes of aggregating risk-weighted vega sensitivities within a bucket, a banking organization must use specific correlation parameters, which vary depending on the risk factor and risk class. 
5. For calculating the net curvature risk position for foreign exchange risk and equity risk, the curvature risk weight is a relative shift equal to the delta risk weight corresponding to the risk factor.
