A trading desk that becomes ineligible can regain eligibility when it produces results in the PLA test green or amber zone and experiences less than or equal to 12 exceptions for actual profit and loss and 12 exceptions for hypothetical profit and loss at the 99.0th percentile and 30 exceptions at the 97.5th percentile in the most recent 250 business day period.
