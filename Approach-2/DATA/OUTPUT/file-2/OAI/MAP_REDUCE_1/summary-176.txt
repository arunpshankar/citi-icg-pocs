1. A banking organization must measure the CVA vega sensitivity to each vega risk factor for commodity risk by multiplying the current values of the volatilities for all commodities in the bucket by 1.01 and dividing the resulting change in the reference value by 0.01.
2. A banking organization may use smaller values of risk factor changes than what is specified if doing so is consistent with internal risk management calculations.
3. When CVA vega sensitivities are calculated, the volatility shift must apply to both types of volatilities that appear in exposure models: volatilities used for generating risk factor paths and volatilities used for pricing options.
4. In cases where a standardized CVA risk covered position or a standardized CVA hedge references an index, the sensitivities of the aggregate regulatory CVA or the market value of the eligible CVA hedge to all risk factors upon which the value of the index depends must be calculated.
5. For the risk classes of counterparty credit spread risk, reference credit spread risk, and equity risk, a banking organization may choose to introduce a set of additional risk factors that directly correspond to qualified credit and equity indices.
