1. When applying the full look-through approach, a banking organization must apply a risk weight determined under a specific section or a risk weight of 1,250 percent. If using the alternative modified look-through approach, a 1,250 percent risk weight must be applied.
2. For equity exposures to an investment fund held by another investment fund, the banking organization must use the full look-through approach, the alternative modified look-through approach, or multiply the exposure amount by a 1,250 percent risk weight.
3. The risk-weighted assets for operational risk equals the operational risk capital requirement multiplied by 12.5. The operational risk capital requirement equals the Business Indicator Component multiplied by the Internal Loss Multiplier.
4. The Business Indicator Component is calculated based on the banking organization's Business Indicator, which is the sum of three components: the interest, lease, and dividend component; the services component; and the financial component.
5. The Internal Loss Multiplier is calculated using a specific formula, and average annual total net operational losses are the average of annual total net operational losses over the previous ten years.
