The proposal requires banking organizations to calculate risk-based capital requirements for delta and vega separately. The organization must always measure the sensitivity of regulatory CVA to vega risk factors, regardless of whether the CVA risk covered positions include positions with optionality. The proposal also requires banking organizations to identify all relevant risk factors for delta and vega risk, and to identify the corresponding risk buckets within relevant risk classes. The risk classes specified for delta and vega risk factors related to expected exposure under SA-CVA are generally consistent with those under the sensitivities-based method for market risk. The proposal also specifies two distinct risk classes for credit spread risk: counterparty credit spread risk and reference credit spread risk.
