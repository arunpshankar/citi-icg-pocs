The proposal would not require a banking organization to establish policies and procedures describing the trading strategy or risk management for notional trading desks. However, to qualify for the internal models approach, a notional trading desk must satisfy all general requirements for trading desks. The proposal would require a banking organization to identify any notional trading desks as part of the trading desk structure requirement. Before calculating market risk capital requirements, a banking organization must receive prior written approval from the primary Federal supervisor of its trading desk structure. The proposal would also require a banking organization to have clearly defined trading and hedging strategies for their trading positions that are approved by senior management.
