1. The cross-bucket correlation parameters, Ybc, are defined for different credit qualities across 14 buckets, with speculative and sub-speculative grades treated as one category. 
2. For equity risk, banks must establish buckets based on the reference entity's market capitalization, economy, and sector. The delta risk factor for equity risk is the simultaneous relative shift of all equity spot prices for all reference entities in the bucket. 
3. The delta risk weights for equity risk are set out in Table 8, with different weights assigned to different sectors and economies. The delta cross-bucket correlation parameter for equity risk is 15% for all cross-bucket pairs assigned to bucket numbers 1 to 10 and 0% for all pairs that include bucket 11.
4. For commodity risk, delta buckets are set out in Table 9, with the delta risk factor being the simultaneous relative shift of all commodity spot prices for all commodities in the bucket. The delta cross-bucket correlation for commodity risk is 20% for all cross-bucket pairs assigned to bucket numbers 1 to 10 and 0% for all pairs that include bucket 11.
5. For interest rate risk, a separate vega interest rate risk bucket must be established for each currency
