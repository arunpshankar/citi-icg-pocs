The proposal mandates banking organizations to calculate market risk capital requirements for securitization positions using the standardized approach or the fallback capital requirement. It addresses regulatory arbitrage concerns and deficiencies in the modelling of securitization positions. Defaulted and distressed market risk covered positions should be included only in the standardized default risk capital requirement. The proposal caps the overall market risk capital requirement for defaulted, distressed, and securitization positions at the maximum loss of the position. For equity positions in an investment fund, the proposal requires a banking organization to apply the look-through approach under the standardized measure for market risk or treat the equity position as if it was the tracked index in calculating the delta, vega, and curvature capital requirements.
