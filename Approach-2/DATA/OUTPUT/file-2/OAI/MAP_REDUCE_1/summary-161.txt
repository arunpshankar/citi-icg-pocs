1. A banking organization is not allowed to recognize diversification benefits across default risk categories, and the overall standardized default risk capital requirement is the sum of the default risk capital requirement for each default risk category.
2. For calculating the standardized default risk capital requirement, a banking organization can apply the look-through approach to credit and equity indices that are non-securitization debt or equity positions.
3. The banking organization must calculate the gross default exposure for each non-securitization debt or equity position, determine the long and short direction of a gross default exposure, and calculate the gross default exposure based on the loss given default (LGD) rate, notional amount, and the cumulative profit and loss already realized on the non-securitization position.
4. The banking organization must assign LGD rates to non-securitization debt or equity positions, use the LGD rate of the reference exposure for credit derivatives, and reflect the notional amount of a non-securitization debt or equity position that gives rise to a long or short gross default exposure as a positive or negative value respectively.
5. To calculate the standardized default risk capital requirement for non-securitization debt or equity positions, the banking organization must assign each non-securitization debt or
