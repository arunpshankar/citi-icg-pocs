1. Banking organizations are required to use specific correlation parameters for aggregating risk-weighted delta sensitivities of interest rate risk within a bucket. The correlation parameter between risk-weighted delta sensitivities within the same bucket, with the same tenor but different interest rate curves, equals 99.9 percent.
2. The correlation parameter between risk-weighted delta sensitivities within the same bucket, with different tenors and the same interest rate curve, is set out in Table 2. For different tenors and different interest rate curves, the correlation parameter equals the parameter specified in Table 2 multiplied by 99.9 percent.
3. The correlation parameter between risk-weighted delta sensitivities to different inflation curves within the same bucket equals 99.9 percent. The correlation parameter between a risk-weighted delta sensitivity to the inflation curve and a risk-weighted delta sensitivity to a given tenor of the relevant interest rate curve equals 40 percent.
4. For cross-currency basis curve, the correlation parameter equals zero percent. For aggregating delta bucket-level risk positions across buckets within the interest rate risk class, the cross-bucket correlation parameter equals 50 percent.
5. For credit spread risk for non-securitizations, banking organizations must establish buckets along two dimensions,
