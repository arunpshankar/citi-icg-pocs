The look-through approach allows banking organizations to determine the risk weight of each exposure type in an investment fund, provided the fund's prospectus or similar contract contains sufficient information. The proposal maintains the same risk-weight treatment as the current capital rule, with five exceptions. These include specifying methods for calculating risk-weighted assets for underlying exposures, including off-balance sheet transactions and derivative contracts, and adjusting the average risk weight for equity exposures to investment funds with leverage. The proposal also caps the risk weight at 1,250 percent and sets a minimum risk weight of 20 percent. If a banking organization lacks necessary information, it must assign a 1,250 percent risk weight to its equity exposure to the investment fund.
