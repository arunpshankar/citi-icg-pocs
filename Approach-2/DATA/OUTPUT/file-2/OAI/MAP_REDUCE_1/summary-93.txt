1. A banking organization is required to assume that the seniority of derivative contracts is the same as that of senior unsecured bonds. Adjustments to the market-consensus Expected Loss Given Default (ELGD) can be made if the derivative contracts' seniority differs, but collateral cannot be used as justification for these changes.
2. The regulatory Credit Valuation Adjustment (CVA) calculation will be based on the exposure models used by the banking organization for financial reporting. These models must meet the requirements for regulatory CVA calculation and use the same market and transaction data.
3. The banking organization must simulate all market risk factors material to the transactions for an appropriate number of paths and future time points. The organization must also account for possible non-normality of the distribution of exposures and take into account any significant dependence between exposure and the counterparty's credit quality.
4. Financial collateral can be recognized as a risk mitigant for margined counterparties if it is included in the net independent collateral amount or variation margin amount and the collateral management requirements are satisfied. The exposure model must capture the effects of margining collateral and all relevant contractual features.
5. The proposed Standardized Approach-Credit Valuation Adjustment (SA-CVA) approach requires a banking organization to estimate changes in regulatory C
