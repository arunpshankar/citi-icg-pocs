The banking organization must calculate the exposure amount for each eligible margin loan or repo-style transaction that is not part of a netting set using a specific formula. This formula takes into account the current fair value of the specific instrument, cash, or gold the banking organization has lent, sold subject to repurchase, or posted as collateral to the counterparty. It also considers the appropriate haircut for the exposure and the currency mismatch between the collateral and exposure. The banking organization must use specific haircuts for market price volatility and currency mismatches. If the number of trades in a netting set exceeds 5,000 at any time during a quarter, the banking organization must adjust the haircuts upward based on a holding period of twenty business days for the following quarter.
