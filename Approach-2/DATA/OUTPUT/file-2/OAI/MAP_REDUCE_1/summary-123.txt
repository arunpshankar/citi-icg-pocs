1. Collateral posted by a clearing member bank that is held by a custodian in a bankruptcy-remote manner is not subject to a capital requirement. 
2. The bank must calculate a risk-weighted asset amount for any collateral provided to a CCP, clearing member, or custodian in connection with a cleared transaction. 
3. The bank's total risk-weighted assets for cleared transactions is the sum of the risk-weighted asset amounts for all of its cleared transactions. 
4. The bank must determine the risk-weighted asset amount for a default fund contribution to a CCP at least quarterly, or more frequently if there is a material change in the financial condition of the CCP. 
5. The bank's risk-weighted asset amount for default fund contributions to non-qualifying CCPs equals the sum of such default fund contributions multiplied by 1,250 percent, or an amount determined by the agency, based on factors such as size, structure, and membership characteristics of the CCP and riskiness of its transactions.
