1. The calculation of Expanded Total Risk-Weighted Assets and Standardized Total Risk-Weighted Assets involves applying the corresponding risk weight to the securitization exposure, multiplied by 8 percent. Non-tranched hedges of correlation trading positions use the same risk weights as non-securitization debt or equity positions, but must be excluded from the calculation of the standardized default risk capital requirement.
2. A banking organization must calculate the standardized default risk capital requirement for correlation trading positions by aggregating the bucket-level capital requirements. The organization must also calculate the residual risk add-on for all market risk covered positions, including those with exotic exposure and correlation trading positions with three or more underlying exposures.
3. Certain market risk covered positions can be excluded from the residual risk add-on, such as those that are listed, eligible to be cleared by a CCP or QCCP, and options without path dependent pay-offs or with two or fewer underlyings. The residual risk add-on equals the sum of the gross effective notional amounts of market risk covered positions, multiplied by the prescribed risk weight.
4. To calculate the models-based measure for market risk, a banking organization must have at least one model-eligible trading desk and receive prior written approval from the agency of the
