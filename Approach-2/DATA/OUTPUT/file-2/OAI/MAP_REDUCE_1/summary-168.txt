1. A banking organization must calculate changes in risk factors over a base liquidity horizon using price differentials from overlapping 10-day periods, without scaling up from a shorter horizon. The liquidity horizon lengths are specified in Table 1 as 10, 20, 40, 60, and 120 days.
2. The organization must identify a 12-month period of stress in which its market risk covered positions would experience the largest loss, using either the full set of risk factors or a reduced set. The observation horizon for this period must span back to 2007 at a minimum.
3. The organization must calibrate the liquidity horizon-adjusted ES-based measure to a period of stress for its entire portfolio of market risk covered positions using either a direct or indirect approach. The direct approach uses the full set of risk factors, while the indirect approach follows a specific set of steps to calculate the measure.
4. The organization must update its input data for internal models used to calculate the ES-based measure at least quarterly and reassess its input data whenever market prices undergo material changes. The models must address non-linearities, correlation, and relevant basis risks.
5. The organization must assign a liquidity horizon of 10, 20, 40, 60, or
