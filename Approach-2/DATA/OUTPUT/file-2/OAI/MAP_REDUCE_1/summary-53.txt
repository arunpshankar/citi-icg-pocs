The proposed market risk capital framework would apply to all banking organizations, regardless of their risk measurement approach. The proposal requires banks to have clear policies and procedures for managing market risk, including daily monitoring of position limits. It also specifies a broader set of risk metrics for monitoring at the trading desk level. The proposal would require banks to conduct stress tests at both the entity-wide and trading-desk level at least quarterly. The proposal also enhances the control, oversight, and validation requirements, including the requirement for an independent risk control unit and internal audit function.
