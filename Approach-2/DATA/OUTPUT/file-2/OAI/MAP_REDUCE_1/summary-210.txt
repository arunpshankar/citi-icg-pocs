The term 'total assets' in ยง 324.4 is defined as per 12 CFR ยง 324.401(g). Amendments have been made to ยง 324.10, which include revisions to the minimum capital requirements. For an FDIC-supervised institution subject to subpart E, a supplementary leverage ratio of 3 percent is required. The state savings association's tangible capital ratio is the ratio of its core capital (tier 1 capital) to total assets. The supplementary leverage ratio of an FDIC-supervised institution subject to subpart E is the ratio of its tier 1 capital to total leverage exposure, which is calculated as the sum of the mean of the on-balance sheet assets and the mean of the off-balance sheet exposures.
