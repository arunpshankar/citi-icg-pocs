Market risk covered positions are assigned to risk buckets within risk classes and mapped to risk factors. These risk factors reflect the specific market variables that impact the value of a position. A banking organization would calculate the sensitivity of a market risk covered position to each of the proposed risk factors for delta, vega, and curvature. The proposed sensitivity calculations are intended to estimate how much a market risk covered position's value might change as a result of a specified change in the risk factor. To capture how much the risk factor might change over a defined time horizon in stress conditions, a banking organization would multiply the net delta sensitivity and the net vega sensitivity, respectively, to each risk factor within the risk bucket by the proposed standardized risk weight for the risk bucket.
