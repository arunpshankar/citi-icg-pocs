1. If a banking organization cannot or chooses not to apply the securitization standardized approach, it must apply a 1,250 percent risk weight to the exposure. The total risk-weighted assets for securitization exposures equals the sum of the risk-weighted asset amount for securitization exposures that the banking organization risk weights.
2. A banking organization must deduct from common equity tier 1 capital any after-tax gain-on-sale resulting from a securitization. If the organization has multiple securitization exposures that provide duplicative coverage, it is not required to hold duplicative risk-based capital against the overlapping position.
3. If a banking organization provides support to a securitization in excess of its contractual obligation, it must calculate a risk-weighted asset amount for underlying exposures as if the exposures had not been securitized and must deduct from common equity tier 1 capital any after-tax gain-on-sale resulting from the securitization.
4. A banking organization that has transferred small-business loans and leases on personal property with recourse must include in risk-weighted assets only its contractual exposure to the small-business obligations if certain conditions are met, including that the transaction must be treated as a sale under GAAP and the organization is well capitalized
