The agencies are seeking comments on the appropriateness of allowing banking organizations to net gross default exposures of derivative contracts and underlying positions. They are also considering the treatment of GSE exposures and the non-recognition of offsetting benefits for market risk covered positions where the obligor is unidentified. The proposed rule includes default risk buckets and risk weights for non-securitization debt or equity positions, reflecting counterparty type and credit quality. The agencies are proposing an approach that does not rely on external credit ratings but allows for granularity in the default risk buckets. For securitization positions non-CTP, the proposal allows offsetting between securitization exposures with the same underlying asset pool and belonging to the same tranche.
