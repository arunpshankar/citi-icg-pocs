The proposed rule would require banking organizations to calculate their aggregate trading assets and liabilities over the previous four quarters, rather than just the most recent quarter. This would provide a more stable measure of the organization's trading activities. The rule would also allow organizations to exclude securities related to certain segregated accounts established by a subsidiary from their calculation of aggregate trading assets and liabilities. If an organization exceeds the proposed trading threshold criteria after excluding such accounts, it would be required to include them when calculating market risk capital requirements. The rule would also require a banking organization to comply with the market risk capital requirements beginning the quarter after it meets any of the proposed criteria.
