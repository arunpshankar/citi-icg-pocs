In January 2016, a new framework was published that established minimum capital requirements for market risk, enhancing transparency of banking organizations' market-risk-weighted assets. In 2019, the Basel Committee revised this framework to better capture potential losses for certain types of risks. The proposal would introduce a risk-sensitive standardized methodology for calculating risk-weighted assets for market risk and a new models-based methodology. A banking organization would need approval from its primary Federal supervisor to use the models-based measure for market risk. The proposal also introduces the concept of a trading desk, limiting the use of internal models to those trading desks that can accurately capture the risk of market risk covered positions.
