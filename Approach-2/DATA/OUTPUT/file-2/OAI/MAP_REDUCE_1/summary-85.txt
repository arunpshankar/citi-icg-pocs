The current capital rule requires banking organizations to disclose information about their portfolios and the internal models used to calculate market risk. A new proposal would eliminate certain quantitative disclosures, but retain others related to securitization positions and correlation trading positions. The proposal would also require banking organizations to disclose a comparison of VaR-based estimates to actual gains or losses for each significant portfolio of market risk covered positions. Additionally, the proposal would add new qualitative disclosures related to a banking organization's processes and policies for managing market risk. Finally, the proposal would require banking organizations to provide a quarterly public regulatory report of its measure for market risk.
