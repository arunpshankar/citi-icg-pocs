The agencies are seeking feedback on the proposal to require banking organizations to use the same reduced set of risk factors to identify stress periods and calculate the Internal Models Capital Calculations (IMCCs). The proposal would require banking organizations to use liquidity horizon-adjusted expected shortfall-based measures to calculate the IMCC for model-eligible trading desks. For non-modellable risk factors, the Stressed Expected Shortfall (SES) capital requirement would be similar to the IMCC, but with less recognition for hedging and portfolio diversification. The proposal would also allow banking organizations to use proxies in designing the stress scenario for each risk class of non-modellable risk factors, subject to data quality requirements. The agencies are also seeking comments on the treatment of non-modellable risk factors and whether the SES capital requirement should be scaled by a multiplier to better reflect their risk profile.
