The financial component of a banking organization's business indicator captures trading activities and other activities related to assets and liabilities. The business indicator excludes expenses unrelated to financial services, such as staff expenses and administrative costs, but includes expenses related to operational loss events. The proposal allows banking organizations to exclude activities they no longer conduct, provided they don't carry legacy legal exposure. The business indicator component increases at different rates depending on the level of the business indicator, reflecting the increased operational risk with larger business volumes. The proposal also includes an internal loss multiplier, which increases operational risk capital requirements based on a banking organization's historical operational loss experience.
