1. The proposal introduces new treatments for default credit derivatives, derivative contracts without credit enhancement, overlapping exposures, and non-performing loan securitizations. It also modifies treatments for certain senior securitization exposures and credit-enhancing interest only strips.
2. Operational requirements are proposed to be consistent with the current capital rule, with exceptions. For resecuritization exposures that meet these requirements, the option for banking organizations to treat the exposures as if they hadn't been securitized would be eliminated.
3. The proposal expands the applicability of operational requirements regarding early amortization provisions to synthetic securitizations. If a synthetic securitization includes an early amortization provision, the banking organization would be required to hold risk-based capital against the underlying exposures as if they hadn't been synthetically securitized.
4. The proposal would prohibit an originating banking organization from recognizing the risk-mitigating benefits of a synthetic securitization that includes synthetic excess spread. If a synthetic securitization structure includes synthetic excess spread, the banking organization would be required to maintain capital against all the underlying exposures as if they hadn't been synthetically securitized.
5. The proposal introduces a new requirement for synthetic securitizations that any applicable minimum
