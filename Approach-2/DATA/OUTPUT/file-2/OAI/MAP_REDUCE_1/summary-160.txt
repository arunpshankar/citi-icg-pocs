1. A banking organization may set credit spreads at zero in cases where the delta risk weight results in negative credit spreads for credit spread risk classes. 
2. For aggregating net curvature risk positions, a banking organization must use specific correlation parameters for different risk classes such as interest rate risk, credit spread risk for non-securitization positions, credit spread risk for correlation trading positions, and commodity risk. 
3. The banking organization must calculate the cross-bucket correlation parameters for curvature risk by squaring the corresponding delta correlation parameters. 
4. The banking organization must calculate default risk capital requirements for its market risk covered positions across different default risk categories, including non-securitization debt or equity positions, securitization positions non-CTP, and correlation trading positions. 
5. The standardized default risk capital requirement for non-securitization debt and equity positions or securitization positions non-CTP equals the sum of the bucket-level default risk capital requirements, while the requirement for correlation trading positions must be calculated in accordance with a specific aggregation formula.
