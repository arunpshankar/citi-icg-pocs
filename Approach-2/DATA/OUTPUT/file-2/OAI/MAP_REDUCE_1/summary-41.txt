Under the proposed regulations, banking organizations would need to include operational losses from entities they have acquired or merged with in their total net operational losses. If historical loss data is not available for these entities, a formula would be provided to calculate the losses. Banking organizations could request supervisory approval to exclude operational loss events that are no longer relevant to their risk profile from the calculation. In the case of divestitures, organizations could request to remove historical operational loss events associated with ceased activities. The proposal also introduces a requirement for banking organizations to collect descriptive information about the causes of operational loss events.
