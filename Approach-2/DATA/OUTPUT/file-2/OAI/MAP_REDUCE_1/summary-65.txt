Mortgage definitions are designed to ensure the borrower's ability to repay. Residential mortgage-backed securities backed by qualified residential mortgage loans carry lower credit risk than those backed by non-qualifying loans. The agencies propose to use the existing definition of qualified residential mortgage in the credit risk retention rule to identify low credit risk securities. A sub-prime residential mortgage-backed security would be defined as a security with underlying exposures consisting primarily of higher-priced mortgage loans or high-cost mortgages. The proposal would reduce compliance burden for banking organizations by allowing them to leverage criteria already being used to evaluate mortgage loans for coverage under the prescribed Regulation Z thresholds.
