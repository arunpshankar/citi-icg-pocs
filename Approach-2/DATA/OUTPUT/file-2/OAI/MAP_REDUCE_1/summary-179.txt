1. Vega risk factors for foreign exchange risk represent the simultaneous change of all volatilities for the exchange rate between a bank's base currency and other currencies, with vega risk weights equalling 100 percent. The vega cross-bucket correlation parameter for foreign exchange risk is 60 percent for all currency pairs.
2. For reference credit spread risk, vega risk factors represent the simultaneous shift of the volatilities of all credit spreads of all tenors for all reference names in the bucket, with vega risk weights equalling 100 percent. The vega cross-bucket correlation parameter is defined in the same manner as the delta cross-bucket correlation parameter.
3. For equity risk, the vega risk factor equals the simultaneous shift of the volatilities for all reference entities in the bucket, with vega risk weights equalling 78 percent for large market cap buckets and 100 percent otherwise. The vega cross-bucket correlation parameter varies depending on the bucket numbers.
4. For commodity risk, the vega risk factor equals the simultaneous shift of the volatilities for all commodities in the bucket, with vega risk weights equalling 100 percent. The vega cross-bucket correlation parameter is 20 percent for all cross-bucket pairs that
