A risk factor that passes the risk factor eligibility test and meets all seven proposed data quality requirements may still be deemed unsuitable for use in calculating the Internally Modelled Capital Calculation (IMCC) by the primary Federal supervisor. In such cases, the risk factor must be excluded from the expected shortfall model and subjected to the SES capital requirements for non-modellable risk factors.
