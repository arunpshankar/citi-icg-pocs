The banking organization must disclose its risk management objectives and policies related to counterparty credit risk, including the method used to assign operating limits, policies relating to guarantees and other risk mitigants, and assessments concerning counterparty credit risk. The proposal specifies that a banking organization must provide a breakdown of its credit derivative providers. The proposal also requires disclosure of whether the banking organization provides implicit support to a securitization and the risk-based capital impact of such support. New disclosure tables would require banking organizations to provide further information on the scope of "past due" exposures, CVA risk, operational risk management processes, and the terms and features of its regulatory capital instruments. Market risk for a banking organization results from exposure to price movements caused by changes in market conditions, market events, and issuer events that affect asset prices.
