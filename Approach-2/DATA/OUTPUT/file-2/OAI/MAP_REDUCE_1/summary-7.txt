The current capital rule requires banks under Category I or II capital standards to deduct from regulatory capital any nonsignificant investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions that exceed 10% of the bank's common equity tier 1 capital. Significant investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions not in the form of common stock must be deducted entirely. The proposal would extend these requirements to banks under Category III or IV capital standards. The current capital rule also limits the amount of minority interest that banks under Category I or II capital standards may include in regulatory capital. The proposal would extend these limitations to banks under Category III or IV capital standards.
