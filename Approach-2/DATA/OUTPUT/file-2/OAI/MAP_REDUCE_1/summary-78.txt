1. Banking organizations are required to consistently review risk factor categories and their corresponding liquidity horizon on a quarterly basis. This is to ensure that the selected stress period continues to reflect potential losses for the risk factors of model-eligible trading desks over time.
2. The proposal requires banking organizations to calculate the liquidity horizon-adjusted expected shortfall-based measure at both the entity-wide level for each risk class and across risk classes for all model-eligible trading desks. This calculation is done using the longer proposed liquidity horizons for modellable risk factors within the same risk class.
3. The banking organization would calculate separately the liquidity horizon-adjusted expected shortfall-based measure for modellable risk factors within the same risk class at each proposed liquidity horizon consecutively, starting with the shortest (10 days).
4. To calculate the liquidity horizon-adjusted expected shortfall-based measure at the entity-wide level across risk classes, the banking organization would scale up the 10-day expected shortfall-based measure for all modellable risk factors assigned either the same or a longer liquidity horizon, without distinguishing between risk classes.
5. The proposal also requires banking organizations to calculate the entity-wide expected shortfall-based measures for each risk class and across risk classes using the twelve-month period of stress for which its market risk covered positions on
