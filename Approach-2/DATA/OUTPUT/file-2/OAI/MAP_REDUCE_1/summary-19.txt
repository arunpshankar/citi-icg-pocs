The proposed averaging methodology applies a multiplier of 10 to the average total drawn amount, using an eight-quarter average balance to better reflect a borrower's credit usage. The proposal would modify the credit conversion factors applicable to commitments, simplifying the treatment by no longer differentiating such factors by maturity. A commitment would be subject to a credit conversion factor of 40 percent, except for the unused portion of a commitment that is unconditionally cancelable by the banking organization, which would be subject to a credit conversion factor of 10 percent. The proposal would require institutions subject to Category III or IV capital standards to use the expanded risk-based approach, which includes the requirement to use SA-CCR, and would eliminate the internal models methodology. The proposal would also change how collateral posted to a QCCP by clearing members and the amount of clearing members' prefunded default fund contributions factor into the calculation of Kccp.
