Banking organizations with over $100 billion in total consolidated assets are subject to a standardized approach capital conservation buffer requirement. This requirement is calculated as the sum of the organization's stress capital buffer requirement, applicable countercyclical capital buffer requirement, and applicable GSIB surcharge. The Board is proposing to amend its capital plan rule to take into account capital ratios calculated under the expanded risk-based approach, in addition to the standardized approach. The proposal would also revise the calculation of the stress capital buffer requirement for large banking organizations. The Board is not proposing changes to the targeted severity of the stress capital buffer requirement, as it aims to better reflect the risk of banking organizations' exposures in the calculation of risk-weighted assets.
