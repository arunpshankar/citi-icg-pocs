The proposal aims to limit the increase in capital requirements due to differences in calculating risk-based capital requirements between market risk covered positions held by trading desks subject to the internal models approach and those held by trading desks subject to the standardized approach. There are four other components of the models-based measure for market risk that apply in limited circumstances. The proposal would revise the criteria for determining whether a banking organization is subject to the market risk-based capital requirements to reflect the significant growth in capital markets since the adoption of the 1996 rule. The proposal would also promote consistency and comparability in market risk capital requirements across banking organizations. The proposed scope is designed to apply market risk capital requirements to all large banking organizations.
