The proposal aims to strengthen risk-based capital requirements for large banking organizations, improving their risk sensitivity and comprehensiveness. It would determine capital requirements for lending activities based on a combination of credit risk and operational risk frameworks, which could slightly increase capital requirements for lending activity. Capital requirements for trading activities would be determined by market risk, CVA risk, and operational risk frameworks, potentially leading to a substantial increase. The proposal would apply revised capital requirements to banking organizations subject to Category I, II, III, or IV capital standards, and to banking organizations with significant trading activity. The agencies estimate that the proposal would increase total risk-weighted assets by 20 percent for holding companies subject to Category I, II, III or IV standards, and by 9 percent for depository institutions subject to these standards.
