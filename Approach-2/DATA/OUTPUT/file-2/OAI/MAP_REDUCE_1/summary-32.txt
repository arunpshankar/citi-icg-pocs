1. The proposal maintains the current capital rule's methods for calculating the adjusted carrying value for equity exposures, with one exception: it simplifies the treatment of conditional commitments to acquire an equity exposure by removing the differentiation of conversion factors by maturity. 
2. A banking organization is required to multiply the effective notional principal amount of a conditional commitment by a 40 percent conversion factor to calculate its adjusted carrying value. 
3. The proposal introduces a risk-weighted asset amount for an equity exposure, which is the product of the adjusted carrying value of the equity exposure multiplied by the lowest applicable risk weight. 
4. The proposal revises the risk weights applicable to other types of equity exposures to enhance risk sensitivity and simplify the equity framework, including the introduction of a 1,250 percent risk weight for certain equity exposures to investment firms. 
5. The proposal retains the treatment of equity exposures that qualify as community development investments and equity exposures to small business investment companies under the current capital rule and assigns such exposures a 100 percent risk weight.
