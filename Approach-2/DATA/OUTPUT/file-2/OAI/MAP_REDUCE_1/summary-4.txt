The proposal aims to extend the application of the countercyclical capital buffer to banking organizations subject to Category IV capital standards. This tool increases capital requirements for large banks during periods of elevated risk, enhancing the resilience of the financial system. The proposal also modifies how the countercyclical capital buffer amount is determined, reflecting changes to market risk capital requirements. Additionally, the proposal expands the application of the supplementary leverage ratio requirement to banking organizations subject to Category IV capital standards. This change ensures all large banking organizations are subject to a consistent and robust leverage requirement, taking into account on- and off-balance sheet exposures.
