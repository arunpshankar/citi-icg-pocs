1. Banking organizations must calculate the cross-bucket correlation parameter Ybc for aggregating delta bucket-level risk positions across buckets within the credit spread risk for non-securitizations risk class. This calculation depends on whether the two delta sensitivities are related to the same curves, and whether the two buckets belong to the same sector or have different credit quality categories.
2. For credit spread risk for correlation trading positions, banking organizations must establish buckets along two dimensions, credit quality and sector. Each delta sensitivity must be assigned to one and only one of the sector buckets, following market convention.
3. Risk weighted delta sensitivities for credit spread risk for correlation trading positions are calculated using the risk weights in Table 5. These weights are the same for all tenors within a bucket.
4. For aggregating risk weighted delta sensitivities of credit spread risk for correlation trading positions within a bucket, banking organizations must use specific correlation parameters. These parameters depend on whether the two names of delta sensitivities to risk factors, the two tenors of the delta sensitivities to risk factors, and the two delta sensitivities are related to the same curve.
5. For bucket 17, the delta bucket-level risk position equals the sum of the absolute values of the risk weighted delta sensitivities allocated
