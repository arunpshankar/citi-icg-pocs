1. The SA-CCR final rule requires banking organizations to apply a supervisory delta adjustment to account for the sensitivity of a derivative contract to the underlying primary risk factor. For a derivative contract that is a CDO tranche, the supervisory delta adjustment is calculated using a specific formula. The sign of the supervisory delta adjustment for CDO tranches is positive if the CDO tranches were used to purchase credit protection and negative if they were used to sell credit protection.
2. The supervisory delta adjustment for option contracts is calculated based on the Black-Scholes formulas for delta sensitivity of European call and put option contracts. The SA-CCR final rule uses modified Black-Scholes formulas that are based on a shifted lognormal probability distribution, which allows negative values of the underlying instrument or risk factor.
3. The SA-CCR final rule sets λ to zero for all asset classes except the interest rate asset class, which has exhibited negative values in some currencies in recent years. For the interest rate asset class, a banking organization must set the value of λ for a given currency equal to the greater of the negative of the lowest value of the strike prices and the current values of the interest rate underlying all interest rate options in a given currency that the banking organization has with
