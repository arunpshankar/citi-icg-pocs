The revisions to ยง 217.10 of Subpart B-Capital Ratio Requirements and Buffers include changes to paragraphs (a)(1)(v), (b), (c), (d), and (d)(3)(ii). The revised regulations stipulate that a Board-regulated institution subject to subpart E must maintain a supplementary leverage ratio of 3 percent. The supplementary leverage ratio is calculated as the ratio of the institution's tier 1 capital to total leverage exposure, which includes both on-balance sheet assets and off-balance sheet exposures. The total leverage exposure also includes the balance sheet carrying value of all the institution's on-balance sheet assets, net of adjusted allowances for credit losses, and the value of securities sold under a repurchase transaction or a securities lending transaction. The regulations also provide detailed instructions for calculating the replacement cost of each derivative contract or single product netting set of derivative contracts.
