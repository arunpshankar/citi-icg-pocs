1. A banking organization's non-default risk capital requirement is calculated using the internally modelled capital calculation (IMCC) and the stressed expected shortfall (SES), with a capital multiplier of 1.5 unless otherwise specified. 
2. The standardized approach capital requirement is defined for market risk covered positions and term repo-style transactions that the banking organization includes in market risk on all trading desks, model-ineligible trading desks, and model-eligible trading desks. 
3. The fallback capital requirement is calculated using the standardized approach capital requirement for any market risk covered positions and the sum of the absolute value of the fair values of all other market risk covered positions. 
4. If a banking organization is unable to calculate the sensitivities-based capital requirement or the standardized default risk capital requirement for a market risk covered position, that position must be excluded from the calculation of the standardized approach capital requirement and included in the fallback capital requirement. 
5. After the initial designation of an exposure to be capitalized, a banking organization may make a re-designation with prior approval of senior management and must calculate its capital add-on for re-designation following a specified approach.
