The proposal outlines the capital treatment of internal Credit Valuation Adjustment (CVA) risk transfers between a CVA desk and a trading desk. It requires a banking organization to have a dedicated CVA desk that manages internal risk transfers of CVA risk. The proposal also requires a banking organization to maintain a record of each internal derivative transaction executed between the CVA and trading desks. If the internal risk transfer is subject to curvature risk, default risk, or the residual risk add-on, the trading desk must execute an external transaction with a third party. The proposal also sets forth general requirements for the recognition of CVA hedges applicable to both internal transfers of CVA risk and external CVA hedges.
