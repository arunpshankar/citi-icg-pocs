1. A banking organization must calculate a bucket-level risk position for each risk factor, including delta risk, vega risk, and curvature risk, by aggregating the risk-weighted sensitivities across risk factors with common characteristics. 
2. The risk class-level capital requirement is calculated by aggregating the bucket-level risk positions for each risk class under three correlation scenarios. This requirement is the sum of the delta, vega, and curvature capital requirements for the respective correlation scenario. 
3. The sensitivities-based capital requirement is calculated by summing the risk class-level capital requirements for each risk class under each correlation scenario, with the largest capital requirement produced under the three scenarios being the final requirement. 
4. The delta capital requirement is calculated for all market risk covered positions, except those exclusively dependent on an exotic exposure. This involves calculating the delta sensitivities of the market risk covered positions to the relevant risk factors, multiplying the sensitivities by the corresponding risk weights, and aggregating the resulting risk-weighted delta sensitivities. 
5. The vega and curvature capital requirements are calculated for market risk covered positions that are options or have embedded optionality, including positions with material prepayment risk. The curvature capital requirement also involves applying an upward and downward shock to each risk factor.
