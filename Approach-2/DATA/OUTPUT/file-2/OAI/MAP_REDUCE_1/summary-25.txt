1. The proposal suggests excluding certain in-scope transactions from the minimum haircut floors as they do not pose the same credit and liquidity risks as other in-scope transactions and are crucial for liquidity and intermediation services provided by banking organizations.
2. Questions are raised about alternative definitions of "in-scope transactions", the potential difficulties banking organizations might face in identifying exempt transactions, and the operational burdens imposed by the proposal.
3. The proposal establishes minimum haircut floors for in-scope transactions, which are derived from observed historical price volatilities and existing market and central bank haircut conventions.
4. The minimum haircut floors are intended to reflect the minimum amount of collateral banking organizations should receive when undertaking in-scope transactions with unregulated financial institutions.
5. The proposal also outlines the process for determining whether an in-scope transaction meets the applicable minimum haircut floor, including a flow chart and a table of minimum haircut floors by collateral types and maturity.
