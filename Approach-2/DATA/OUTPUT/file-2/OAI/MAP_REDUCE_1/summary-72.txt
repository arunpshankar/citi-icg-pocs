1. The default risk capital requirement for a convertible bond is the sum of the default risk capital of the vanilla bond and the default risk capital requirement for the equity option. 
2. When calculating the delta and curvature capital requirements for index instruments and multi-underlying options, a banking organization is generally required to apply a look-through approach, identifying the underlying positions and calculating market risk capital requirements as if the organization directly held the underlying exposures. 
3. In some cases, a banking organization may choose not to apply a look-through approach to listed and well-diversified indices, instead using a single sensitivity for the index to calculate the delta and curvature capital requirements. 
4. The default risk of multi-underlying options that are non-securitization debt or equity positions is primarily a function of the idiosyncratic default risk of the underlying constituents, requiring a banking organization to apply the look-through approach when calculating the standardized default risk capital requirement. 
5. The proposal would allow a banking organization to decompose the index position when calculating the standardized default risk capital requirement, providing greater hedging recognition as the organization would be able to offset the gross default exposure of long and short positions in indices with that of single-name positions included in the index.
