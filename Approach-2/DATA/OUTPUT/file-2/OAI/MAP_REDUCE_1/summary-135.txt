1. The total net operational losses of a quarter are calculated by summing any portions of losses or recoveries of any material operational losses allocated to that quarter. A material operational loss is defined as a net loss greater than or equal to $20,000 after considering all subsequent recoveries related to the operational loss.
2. If a banking organization lacks complete operational loss event data due to a merger or acquisition, it must calculate the annual total net operational loss contribution for each year of missing data using a specific formula. This formula takes into account the Business Indicator contribution of the merged or acquired business and the average annual total net operational loss of the banking organization.
3. If a banking organization does not have operational loss event data for the entire ten-year period, it must adjust its calculations. If it has five or more years of data, it must calculate average annual total net operational losses using only this data. If it has less than five years of data, it must set the Internal Loss Multiplier to one.
4. A banking organization can request approval to exclude from its operational loss events those associated with an activity it has ceased to conduct or those that are no longer relevant to its risk profile. However, the operational loss events must represent a total net operational loss amount equal to five
