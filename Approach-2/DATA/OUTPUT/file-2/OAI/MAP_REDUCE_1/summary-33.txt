The proposal aims to modify the risk assessment of publicly traded equity exposures with tradability restrictions. It plans to remove the 100 percent risk weight for non-significant equity exposures and introduce a 250 percent risk weight, replacing the current 300 percent risk weight. This change is designed to improve the consistency and risk-sensitivity of the framework. The proposal also addresses equity exposures to investment firms with significant leverage. It suggests increasing the risk weight from 600 percent to 1,250 percent for such exposures. The proposal also allows the primary federal supervisor to determine if an exposure is not a traditional securitization and require a 1,250 percent risk weight to be applied.
