1. The proposed requirements would necessitate restructuring outside of insolvency, with the banking organization's consent, ensuring that credit derivatives without restructuring as a credit event are recognized similarly under the capital framework. 
2. The agencies are seeking comments on the appropriateness of allowing banking organizations to fully recognize the effective notional amount of credit derivatives that do not include restructuring as a credit event, questioning if the exemption from the 40 percent haircut is too broad. 
3. The proposal would only allow a banking organization to recognize the risk-mitigating benefits of a corporate debt security that meets the definition of financial collateral in expanded risk-weighted assets if the corporate issuer of the debt security has a publicly traded security outstanding. 
4. The proposal would maintain the simple approach of the current capital rule, including restrictions on collateral eligibility and the risk-weight floor, except for the proposed requirement for certain corporate debt securities. 
5. The proposal would also introduce a new method to calculate the exposure amount of eligible transactions in a netting set and simplify the existing exposure calculation method for individual transactions that are not part of a netting set.
