The proposal outlines a system for categorizing bank exposure based on the financial strength of the obligor institution, using publicly disclosed capital levels. Grade A bank exposure refers to an investment grade institution with capital ratios that meet or exceed certain requirements. Grade B bank exposure refers to an institution that is either speculative or investment grade, with capital ratios that meet or exceed minimum requirements. Grade C bank exposure refers to an institution that does not qualify as Grade A or B, such as one that has not publicly disclosed its capital ratios within the last six months. For foreign banks to qualify as Grade A or B, they must meet international capital standards. The proposal also introduces a definition and risk weight treatment for subordinated debt instruments.
