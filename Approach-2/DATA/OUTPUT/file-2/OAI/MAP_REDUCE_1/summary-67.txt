The proposed correlation parameters for banking organizations closely follow those in the Basel III reforms, calibrated to capture market correlations over a long time horizon. The proposal would require banking organizations to use these parameters for each risk factor pair when calculating capital requirements for delta, vega, and curvature. For securitization positions non-CTP, a 100 percent intra-bucket correlation parameter is proposed for positions in the same bucket and related to the same securitization tranche with more than 80 percent overlap in notional terms. For risk factors allocated to the "other sector" bucket within the credit spread and equity risk classes, no correlation parameters would apply. The proposal aims to capture the potential interactions between risk factors that the market risk covered positions may experience in a time of stress.
