1. The proposed treatment for securitization aligns with the maximum potential capital requirement under either subpart D or E of the capital rule. The agencies are seeking comments on the proposed risk buckets and the potential benefits and drawbacks of aligning the default risk bucketing structure with the proposed delta risk buckets for non-CTP securitization positions.
2. The process to calculate the standardized default risk capital requirement for correlation trading positions is similar to that for non-securitization debt and equity positions, with differences in the metrics used to measure gross default exposure, the offsetting of long and short exposures, the risk buckets, and the aggregation of bucket level exposures.
3. The proposal allows banking organizations to offset gross long and short default exposures in specific cases, including identical correlation trading positions except for maturity, long and short exposures of tranches that are perfect replications of non-tranched correlation trading positions, and indices and single-name constituents in the indices through decomposition.
4. For correlation trading positions, the proposal defines risk buckets by index, with each index comprising its own risk bucket. A bespoke correlation trading position would be assigned to its own unique bucket unless it is substantially similar to an index instrument.
5. The agencies propose a residual risk add-on capital requirement
