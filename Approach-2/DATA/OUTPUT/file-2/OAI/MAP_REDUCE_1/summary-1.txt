The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Board), and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) are proposing changes to capital requirements for large banking organizations with assets over $100 billion and those with significant trading activity. The proposed changes aim to strengthen the calculation of risk-based capital requirements to better reflect the risks of these banking organizations' exposures. The revisions also aim to enhance consistency of requirements across large banking organizations and facilitate more effective supervisory and market assessments of capital adequacy. These changes follow reforms adopted after the 2007-09 financial crisis to improve the effectiveness of the regulatory capital framework. The proposal includes changes to the calculation of capital ratios, definitions of capital, credit risk, securitization framework, equity risk, operational risk, disclosure requirements, market risk, credit valuation adjustment risk, and transition provisions.
