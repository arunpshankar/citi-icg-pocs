The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal Reserve System, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation are proposing revisions to the capital requirements for large banking organizations and those with significant trading activity. The proposed revisions aim to improve risk-based capital requirements, reduce complexity, enhance consistency, and facilitate better supervision and market assessments. The revisions would replace current requirements with standardized approaches and align with international capital standards. The proposal does not affect smaller, less complex banking organizations. Public comments on the proposal are invited until November 30, 2023.
