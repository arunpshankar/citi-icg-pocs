The proposal aims to strengthen risk-based capital requirements for large banking organizations by improving their comprehensiveness and risk sensitivity. It would align capital requirements with risk-taking to ensure banks internalize the risk of their operations. The proposal is expected to have a modest impact on lending activities, resulting in a slight reduction in bank lending. However, the economic benefits associated with increased financial system resilience are expected to outweigh the costs. Capital requirements for trading activities would increase substantially, depending on banking organizations' implementation of internal models. The proposal would also impact other connected rules and regulations.
