The information provided discusses the calculation of exposure amounts and risk weights for counterparty credit risk in OTC derivative contracts. The effective maturity of netting sets is determined based on the weighted-average remaining maturity of individual positions within the netting set. The EAD of the netting set is calculated using the same methodology as the exposure amount for counterparty credit risk. A discount factor is applied to the calculation based on the effective maturity of the netting set. Risk weights for counterparties are determined based on their sector and credit quality. The standardized measure for CVA risk requires ongoing calculations and risk management procedures, and approval from the regulatory agency is necessary to use this measure.
