The proposal aims to increase the credit risk-sensitivity of capital requirements for retail exposures by assigning risk weights based on product type and portfolio diversification. The definition of a retail exposure would include exposures to natural persons, small or medium-sized entities (SMEs), and exclude real estate-related exposures. The proposal introduces separate risk-weight treatments for real estate exposures. Retail exposures would be categorized as regulatory retail exposures, transactor exposures, or other retail exposures based on specific criteria. Risk weights of 55%, 85%, and 110% would be assigned to regulatory retail exposures that are transactor exposures, regulatory retail exposures that are not transactor exposures, and other retail exposures, respectively. The proposal includes limits on the amount of retail exposures that can be treated as regulatory retail exposures based on aggregate and granularity criteria.
