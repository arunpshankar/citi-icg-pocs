The proposed market risk capital framework requires banking organizations to document all material aspects of their market risk positions, including internal risk transfers and re-designations. It also requires documentation of internal models, control processes, and capital adequacy assessments. Banking organizations must explain the empirical techniques used to measure market risk and establish and document their trading desk structure. The proposal includes additional operational requirements for the use of internal models, including validation and review processes. Trading desks must be identified and designated as model-eligible, and certain desks may be exempted from the internal models approach. The proposal also requires ongoing review, risk management, and validation of internal models, including monitoring and comparison with external data sources.
