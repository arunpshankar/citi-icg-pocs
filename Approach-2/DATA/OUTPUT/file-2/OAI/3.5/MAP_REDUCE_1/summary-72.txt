The proposal suggests using a look-through approach to calculate the default risk capital requirement for index instruments and multi-underlying options. This approach would require identifying the underlying positions and calculating market risk capital requirements as if the banking organization directly held those positions. Well-diversified indices may be treated as a single position. The proposal also outlines a waterfall approach to assign sensitivities to relevant sectors or index buckets for listed and well-diversified indices. When calculating vega capital requirements, banking organizations have the option to apply the look-through approach or use implied volatility. The default risk of multi-underlying options is primarily based on the default risk of the underlying constituents. The proposal allows for the decomposition of index positions and provides greater hedging recognition. The agencies seek comments on the proposed thresholds and treatment of index instruments and multi-underlying options.
