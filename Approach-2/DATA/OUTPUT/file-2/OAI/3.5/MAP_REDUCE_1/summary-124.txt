1. QCCPs located outside the United States can use a value of 10 business days for calculating exposure amount, including collateral and default fund contributions.
2. Exposure amount for repo-style transactions between clearing members and QCCPs is calculated based on the exposure amount of the QCCP to each clearing member, initial margin collateral, and prefunded default fund contributions.
3. Exposure amount must be calculated separately for each clearing member's sub-client accounts and sub-house accounts, with independent collateral allocated proportionally.
4. If an account contains both derivative contracts and repo-style transactions, the exposure amount is the sum of the exposure amounts for each type of transaction, with collateral allocated proportionally.
5. In the case of unsettled transactions, risk-based capital requirements apply to delivery-versus-payment (DvP) and payment-versus-payment (PvP) transactions with a normal settlement period, and risk-weighted asset amounts are determined based on positive current exposure and the number of business days after the settlement date.
