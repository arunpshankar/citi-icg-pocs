(1) A banking organization must apply a 100 percent credit conversion factor (CCF) to certain off-balance-sheet items and transactions, including guarantees, repurchase agreements, credit-enhancing representations and warranties, securities lending and borrowing transactions, financial standby letters of credit, and forward agreements.
(2) For derivative contracts, a banking organization must determine the exposure amount using the standardized approach for counterparty credit risk (SA-CCR). The exposure amount can be reduced by the credit valuation adjustment recognized in the balance sheet valuation of derivative contracts in the netting set.
(3) Definitions include end date and start date for derivative contracts, as well as the concept of hedging sets for different types of derivative contracts.
(4) Credit derivatives purchased by a banking organization are not subject to a separate counterparty credit risk capital requirement if consistently treated as credit risk mitigants and included or excluded from any measure used to determine counterparty credit risk exposure.
(5) Equity derivative contracts are treated as equity exposures and a risk-weighted asset amount is computed. If risk-weighted, the banking organization may choose not to hold risk-based capital against the counterparty credit risk of the equity derivative contract.
