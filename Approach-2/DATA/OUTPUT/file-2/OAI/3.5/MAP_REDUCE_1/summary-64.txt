The proposed rule suggests applying a lower risk weight for interest rate risk in certain currencies specified by the primary Federal supervisor. The rule also sets forth risk buckets and corresponding risk weights for credit spread risk factors in non-securitization positions, correlation trading positions, and securitization positions. The risk buckets are defined based on market sector and credit quality, using alternative criteria to capture creditworthiness without relying on external credit ratings. The proposal includes sectors similar to those in the Basel III reforms and specifies treatment for certain U.S.-specific sectors. The risk weights are based on empirical data reflecting historical stress periods.
