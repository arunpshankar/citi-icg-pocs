The proposed rule would change the calculation of a banking organization's trading activities by using a four-quarter average instead of a single quarter. Certain securities related to segregated accounts established by a subsidiary of a banking organization would be excluded from the calculation of aggregate trading assets and liabilities. If a banking organization exceeds the proposed trading threshold criteria after excluding these accounts, it would be required to include them when calculating market risk capital requirements. The proposal would require a banking organization to comply with market risk capital requirements once it meets the proposed scoping criteria, and it would remain subject to these requirements unless it falls below the trading activity threshold for four consecutive quarters. The proposal would retain the authority for the primary Federal supervisor to require or exclude a banking organization from calculating market risk capital requirements on a case-by-case basis. The agencies are seeking comments on the proposed scope of application thresholds and alternative thresholds that should be considered.
