The proposal introduces three components to calculate a banking organization's operational risk capital requirement: the interest, lease, and dividend component, the services component, and the financial component. The interest, lease, and dividend component captures the organization's interest income and expenses, with a ceiling of 2.25 percent of total interest-earning assets. The services component accounts for fees, commissions, and other financial activities not captured by the other components. The financial component captures trading activities and other activities related to the organization's assets and liabilities. The proposal includes definitions for fee and commission income, fee and commission expense, other operating income, and other operating expense.
