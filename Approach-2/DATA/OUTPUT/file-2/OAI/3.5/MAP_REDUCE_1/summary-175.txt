(9) The exposure model for margined counterparties must capture the effects of margining collateral, including contractual features such as margin agreement type, frequency of margin calls, and collateral type.
(10) Banking organizations must use the same CVA exposure models for financial reporting purposes to obtain simulated paths of discounted future exposure, adjusted to meet regulatory requirements.
(11) The generation of market risk factor paths underlying exposure models must meet certain requirements, including consistent drifts, calibrated volatilities and correlations, and accounting for possible non-normality of exposure distributions.
