The proposal requires banking organizations to include exposure models for regulatory CVA calculation in their risk management framework and have criteria for assessing and remedying unacceptable performance. The exposure models used in regulatory CVA calculation must be part of the ongoing risk management framework and subject to ongoing measurement and management. Banking organizations must document the process for validating their models, including exposure models, and test pricing models against independent benchmarks. They must also obtain current and historical market data and have data integrity processes in place. The proposal provides a basic measure and a standardized measure for calculating CVA risk capital requirements, with the option for banking organizations to use the standardized measure if approved by their primary Federal supervisor. The capital requirements for CVA risk are calculated based on a formula that approximates CVA expected shortfall.
