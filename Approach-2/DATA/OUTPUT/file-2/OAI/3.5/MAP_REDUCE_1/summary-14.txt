The proposal suggests risk weights for regulatory residential real estate exposures based on the loan-to-value (LTV) ratio and whether the exposure is dependent on the cash flows of the real estate. For residential real estate exposures not dependent on cash flows, the risk weights range from 40% to 80% based on different LTV ratios. For exposures dependent on cash flows, the risk weights range from 60% to 125% based on different LTV ratios. The agencies acknowledge that other factors are considered in underwriting residential real estate loans and are interested in feedback on the impact of the proposed treatment on home affordability and homeownership opportunities. The proposal also includes risk weights for regulatory commercial real estate exposures based on the LTV ratio and whether the exposure is dependent on cash flows. Defaulted real estate exposures would require elevated risk weights.
