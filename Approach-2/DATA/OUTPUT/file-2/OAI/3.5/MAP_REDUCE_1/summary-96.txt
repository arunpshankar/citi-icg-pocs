The proposed SA-CVA method would have bucket-level capital requirements for different risk classes, with risk weights and correlations specific to each class. For foreign exchange, reference credit spread, equity, and commodity risk classes, one delta and one vega risk factor would be assigned per risk bucket. The interest rate risk class would have two groups of risk buckets/currencies, with different risk weights and granularity for delta risk factors. The counterparty credit spread risk class would follow the same dynamics as the reference credit spread risk class, but with modifications to the bucket structure to improve recognition of hedges. The proposal also includes requirements for intra- and inter-bucket aggregation of risk-weighted net sensitivities. The agencies are seeking feedback on the appropriateness of these proposed risk buckets, weights, and correlations.
