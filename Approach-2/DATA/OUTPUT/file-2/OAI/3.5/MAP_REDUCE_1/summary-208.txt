(C) is a Category II FDIC-supervised institution. A cleared transaction is not considered a corporate exposure. CVA risk-weighted assets are calculated by multiplying the measure for CVA risk by 12.5. The effective notional amount is the lesser of the contractual notional amount or the exposures amount, multiplied by the percentage coverage. An eligible guarantee must meet certain criteria, including being written, unconditional, and covering all or a portion of contractual payments.
