The proposed treatment for securitization default risk would align with the maximum capital requirement for securitizations. Commenters are asked to provide feedback on the benefits and drawbacks of aligning the default risk bucketing structure with the proposed delta risk buckets. The calculation of the standardized default risk capital requirement for correlation trading positions would be similar to non-securitization debt and equity positions, with some differences in metrics and risk buckets. Banking organizations would be allowed to offset gross long and short default exposures in certain cases to increase risk sensitivity. The proposal also includes a residual risk add-on capital requirement to capture exotic and other residual risks not fully reflected in other capital requirements.
