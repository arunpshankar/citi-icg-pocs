Exposure models used for regulatory CVA calculation must be part of a risk management framework that includes identification, measurement, management, approval, and reporting of CVA risk. Senior management must oversee the risk control process. An independent risk control unit must validate the models used for calculating regulatory CVA, and report directly to senior management. The validation process must be documented and include testing pricing models against independent benchmarks. An independent review of the CVA risk management process must be conducted, and criteria must be defined to assess exposure models and their inputs.
