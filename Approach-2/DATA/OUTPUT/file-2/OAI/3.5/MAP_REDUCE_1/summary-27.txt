The proposed changes include: (1) new treatment for derivative contracts without credit enhancement, (2) modified treatment for overlapping exposures, (3) new capital requirements for certain senior securitization exposures, (4) modification to the treatment for credit-enhancing interest only strips, and (5) a new framework for non-performing loan securitizations. The operational requirements for securitizations would be consistent with current rules, with exceptions for early amortization provisions, synthetic excess spread, and minimum payment thresholds. Resecuritization exposures would have higher capital requirements. The capital requirements for most securitization exposures would be determined under the Securitization Standardized Approach (SEC-SA), which is similar to the current approach with some changes. If accurate information is not available, a 1,250 percent risk weight would be applied.
