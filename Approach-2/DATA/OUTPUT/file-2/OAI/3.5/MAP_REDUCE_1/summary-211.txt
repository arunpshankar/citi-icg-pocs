The FDIC-supervised institution can reduce the notional principal amount of a credit derivative if there is a reduction in its fair value recognized in common equity tier 1 capital. The institution can also reduce the notional principal amount by the same amount of a purchased credit derivative, as long as certain conditions are met. If the mark-to-fair value of the purchased credit derivative increases, the institution must also reduce its notional principal amount. If the institution records net payments received on a credit derivative but does not record any deterioration in its fair value, it cannot use purchased credit protection to offset the notional principal amount. The counterparty credit risk of repo-style transactions must be calculated based on the fair value of the instruments or cash lent or borrowed.
