The primary Federal supervisor has the authority to determine if a model-eligible trading desk complies with the requirements for using the models-based measure for market risk. If the desk does not comply, the supervisor can rescind the desk's model approval and require it to use the standardized approach or subject it to a PLA add-on capital requirement. The proposal allows the supervisor to subject a trading desk to a PLA add-on if its expected shortfall model does not appropriately capture the risk of the desk's market risk covered positions. The supervisor can also rescind its approval of a banking organization's methodology for capturing non-modellable risk factors and require the affected trading desk(s) to use the standardized approach. The proposal introduces a standardized methodology for calculating market risk capital requirements and requires banking organizations with model-eligible trading desks to calculate requirements under both the standardized and models-based measures. The agencies have the authority to require banking organizations to calculate capital requirements for specific positions under different subparts of the capital rule to reflect the risks appropriately.
