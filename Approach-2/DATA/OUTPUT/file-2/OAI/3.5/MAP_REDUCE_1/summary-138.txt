Global systemically important banking holding companies (BHCs) are required to update their disclosures at least semiannually in the event of a redemption, conversion, write down, or other material change in the nature of an existing instrument. They must also disclose the full terms and conditions of all eligible debt securities. The disclosures should include information such as the issuer's legal entity, unique identifier, governing law, regulatory capital treatment, inclusion in capital, instrument type, amount recognized in regulatory capital, par value, accounting classification, original date of issuance, maturity date, call options, coupon or dividend rates, conversion conditions, write-down features, and subordination hierarchy. These requirements apply to BHCs with significant exposure to market risk or credit valuation adjustment (CVA) risk. BHCs must meet these requirements once they meet the criteria specified in the regulations and continue to comply unless they no longer meet the criteria.
