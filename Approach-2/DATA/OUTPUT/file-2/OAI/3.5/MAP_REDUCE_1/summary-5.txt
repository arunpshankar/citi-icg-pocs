The Federal Reserve is proposing changes to the capital requirements for banking organizations. Currently, banking organizations are subject to a standardized approach capital conservation buffer requirement, which is calculated based on stress tests and other factors. The proposal aims to include capital ratios calculated under the expanded risk-based approach in addition to the standardized approach. The stress capital buffer requirement helps ensure that banking organizations can withstand losses while still meeting regulatory capital requirements. The proposal also includes changes to the definition of capital for certain banking organizations. The Federal Reserve is seeking feedback on the appropriate level of risk capture and adjustments to the framework.
