The information provided discusses the proposed regulations for securitization exposures. It states that senior securitization exposures may have a risk weight calculated under the SEC-SA or 100 percent, whichever is lower. There is a proposed risk-weight cap to recognize that the credit risk of a senior securitization exposure is generally not greater than the credit risk of the underlying assets. However, there is a proposed 15 percent floor for the total risk-based capital requirement to account for additional risks introduced by securitization. The treatment for credit-enhancing interest only strips (CEIOS) would be different under the proposed regulations, requiring deduction from common equity tier 1 capital. The proposal also introduces a specific approach for non-performing loan (NPL) securitization exposures, assigning a risk weight of 100 percent if certain conditions are met. The nonrefundable purchase price discount would be calculated based on the difference between the outstanding balance of the underlying exposures and the price at which they are sold.
