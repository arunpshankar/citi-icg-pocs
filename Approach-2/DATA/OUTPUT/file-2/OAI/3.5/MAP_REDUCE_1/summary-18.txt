The proposal suggests defining project finance exposures as corporate exposures where the banking organization relies on revenues from a single project as repayment and security for the loan. These exposures would need to meet certain criteria, such as being to a borrowing entity created specifically for the project and having an immaterial amount of assets apart from project revenues. Project finance exposures would receive a 130% risk weight during the pre-operational phase and a 100% risk weight during the operational phase. Off-balance sheet exposures, such as commitments and guarantees, would be subject to credit conversion factors ranging from 10% to 100% based on the expected proportion of the exposure that would become an on-balance sheet credit exposure. Commitments without a pre-set limit would be calculated using an averaging methodology.
