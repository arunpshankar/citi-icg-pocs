A banking organization must have clearly defined trading and hedging strategies for its market risk covered positions, approved by senior management. The organization must also define its trading desk structure, including the identification of different types of trading desks. Each trading desk must have a clearly defined policy approved by senior management, outlining the general strategy, risk and position limits, and internal controls. The organization must have policies and procedures for actively managing market risk covered positions, including daily valuation, ongoing assessment of hedging abilities, and establishment of trading limits. Stress testing of market risk must be conducted regularly, and the organization must have internal market risk management systems and independent oversight through a risk control unit and internal audit function.
