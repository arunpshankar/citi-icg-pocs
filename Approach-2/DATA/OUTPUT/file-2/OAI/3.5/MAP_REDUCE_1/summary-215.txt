FDIC-supervised institutions must assign appropriate risk weights to certain investments under subparts D, E, or F of the regulations. With prior approval from the FDIC, institutions subject to subpart E are not required to deduct significant investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions if the purpose is to provide financial support. The amount of certain items that are not deducted from common equity tier 1 capital must be included in risk-weighted assets and assigned a 250 percent risk weight. There are revisions to sections related to derivative contracts, cleared transactions, collateralized transactions, and disclosures by FDIC-supervised institutions. The regulations also specify the applicability of subpart E to certain types of institutions and provide criteria for determining if an institution is well capitalized for securitization exposures.
