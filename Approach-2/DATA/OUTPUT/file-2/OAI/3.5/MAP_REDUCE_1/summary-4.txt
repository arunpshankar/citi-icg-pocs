The proposal aims to expand the application of the countercyclical capital buffer to banking organizations subject to Category IV capital standards. This tool increases capital requirements for large banking organizations during periods of elevated risk. The proposal also suggests applying the supplementary leverage ratio requirement to Category IV banking organizations to ensure consistent and robust leverage requirements. The proposal would require large banking organizations to calculate total risk-weighted assets under both the expanded risk-based approach and the standardized approach. The proposal also introduces an "output floor" to ensure consistency in capital requirements and prevent unwarranted reductions in capital. Finally, the proposal includes a stress capital buffer requirement to maintain capital ratios above minimum requirements.
