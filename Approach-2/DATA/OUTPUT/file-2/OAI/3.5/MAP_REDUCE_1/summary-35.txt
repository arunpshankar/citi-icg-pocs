The proposed regulations introduce a look-through approach for calculating risk weights for equity exposures to investment funds. This approach requires banking organizations to use information from the fund's prospectus or partnership agreement to determine the risk weight for each type of exposure. To account for limited information or lack of verification, conservative assumptions must be used. The proposal maintains the risk-weight treatment from the current capital rule but introduces five exceptions, including specifying methods for calculating risk-weighted assets for underlying exposures and capping the risk weight at 1,250 percent. The proposal also allows for conservative assumptions when calculating risk-weighted assets for securitization exposures and derivative exposures.
