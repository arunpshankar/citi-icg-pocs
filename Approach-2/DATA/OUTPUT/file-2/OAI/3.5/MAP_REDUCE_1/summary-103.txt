The proposed rule includes revisions to current information collections subject to the PRA. The agencies would revise and extend reporting, recordkeeping, and disclosure requirements associated with regulatory capital rules and market risk capital rules. The Board would also revise and extend financial statements for holding companies, capital assessments and stress testing, and the systemic risk report. The agencies, under the FFIEC, would propose related revisions to consolidated reports of condition and income, regulatory capital reporting, and market risk regulatory reporting. Comments are invited on the necessity, accuracy, quality, and burden of the information collections.
