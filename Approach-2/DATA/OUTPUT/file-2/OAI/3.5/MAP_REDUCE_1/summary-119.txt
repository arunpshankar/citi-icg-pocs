(5) A banking organization can choose to treat a cleared derivative contract as if it is subject to a variation margin agreement if daily cash payments are made to account for changes in the contract's fair value. This applies to all derivative contracts within the same netting set.
(6) A banking organization can treat certain derivative contracts that reference an index as multiple contracts referencing individual components of the index, as long as they are not options or CDO tranches.
(7) A clearing member banking organization can adjust the standard supervisory haircuts for client-facing derivative transactions by multiplying them by a scaling factor of 0.707107. A longer holding period may require a larger scaling factor, as determined by the banking organization or regulatory agency.
(f) The replacement cost of a netting set is calculated differently depending on whether it is subject to a variation margin agreement or not. The replacement cost is the greater of the fair values of the derivative contracts minus collateral and variation margin, the variation margin threshold minus collateral, or zero.
(g) The potential future exposure of a netting set is calculated by multiplying the PFE multiplier by the aggregated amount. The PFE multiplier is determined based on the fair values of the derivative contracts and the collateral and variation margin.
