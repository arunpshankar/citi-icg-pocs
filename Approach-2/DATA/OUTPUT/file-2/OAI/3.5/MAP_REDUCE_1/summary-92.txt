The information provided discusses the calculation of expected shortfall for index hedges and the determination of supervisory risk weights for these hedges. It also introduces the standardized approach for CVA risk, which is an adaptation of the sensitivities-based method used in the standardized measure for market risk. The SA-CVA calculation reflects capital requirements for delta and vega risk factors and includes adjustments for model risk. The proposal also outlines the calculation of regulatory CVA, which is the sum of counterparty-level regulatory CVAs. The calculation of regulatory CVA requires inputs such as the term structure of market-implied probability of default, market-consensus expected loss-given-default, and simulated paths of discounted future exposure.
