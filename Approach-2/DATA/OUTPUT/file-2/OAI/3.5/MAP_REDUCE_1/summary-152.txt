(i) Implied volatility remains unchanged for an option or market risk position with an embedded option when the price of the underlying changes, either based on moneyness or strike price.
(ii) For credit spread risk in securitization positions, the curvature scenarios and sensitivities must be calculated based on the spread of the tranche rather than the underlying position.
(iii) For correlation trading positions, the curvature scenarios and sensitivities must be computed based on the underlying names of the securitization position.
(iv) Delta sensitivities, vega sensitivities, and curvature scenarios must be calculated for each risk class in the reporting currency, except for foreign exchange risk where it can be calculated relative to a base currency with approval.
(v) CVA impact should be ignored when calculating sensitivities.
(vi) Delta sensitivity for interest rate risk is calculated by changing the interest rate curve by one basis point and dividing the resulting change in value by 0.0001.
(vii) Delta sensitivity for credit spread risk is calculated by changing the credit spread by one basis point and dividing the resulting change in value by 0.0001.
(viii) Delta sensitivity for equity risk is calculated using the equity spot price and equity repo rate.
(ix) Delta sensitivity for commodity risk
