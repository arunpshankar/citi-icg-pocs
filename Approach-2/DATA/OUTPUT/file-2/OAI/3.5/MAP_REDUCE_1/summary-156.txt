1) When the names of the delta sensitivities to risk factors are the same, the basis is 100 percent, otherwise it is 99.9 percent.
2) When the tenors of the delta sensitivities to risk factors are the same, the basis is 100 percent, otherwise it is 65 percent.
3) For aggregating delta bucket-level risk positions, the cross-bucket correlation parameter is calculated based on whether the delta sensitivities are related to the same curves or not.
4) For credit spread risk for non-securitizations, the cross-bucket correlation parameter is 50 percent if the buckets have different credit quality categories, otherwise it is 100 percent.
5) For credit spread risk for correlation trading positions, the risk weights and correlation parameters are determined based on the credit quality and sector of the delta sensitivities.
