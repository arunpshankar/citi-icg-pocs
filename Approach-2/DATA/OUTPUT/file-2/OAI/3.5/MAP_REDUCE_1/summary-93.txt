The proposal requires banking organizations to assume that derivative contracts have the same seniority as senior unsecured bonds. If the derivative contracts are more or less senior, the organization can adjust the market-consensus Expected Loss Given Default (ELGD) to reflect the lower or higher losses. Collateral provided by the counterparty cannot be used as justification for changing the ELGD. The proposal aligns the regulatory Credit Valuation Adjustment (CVA) calculation with industry practices, using exposure models and market data. Financial collateral can be recognized as a risk mitigant if certain requirements are met. The proposal outlines the calculation process for the standardized approach to CVA, including identifying risk classes, calculating sensitivities, and aggregating capital requirements. Diversification benefits are not recognized in the capital requirements.
