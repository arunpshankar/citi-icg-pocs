The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Board), and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) are proposing to modify the capital requirements for banking organizations with total assets of $100 billion or more and those with significant trading activity. The proposed revisions aim to strengthen risk-based capital requirements and enhance consistency across large banking organizations. These changes are intended to better reflect the risks of these organizations' exposures and improve capital adequacy assessments. The agencies previously adopted reforms after the 2007-09 financial crisis to increase the quantity and quality of regulatory capital that banking organizations must maintain.
