The proposal suggests using delta risk factors to appropriately capture the delta sensitivity for positions within the commodity risk class. For foreign exchange risk, the delta risk factors would be based on the exchange rates between the currency in which the position is denominated and the reporting currency. Banking organizations may also calculate delta risk factors relative to a base currency if approved by the primary Federal supervisor. The proposal defines vega risk factors for foreign exchange risk as the implied volatility of options that reference exchange rates. Banking organizations may treat onshore and offshore exchange rates as two distinct risk factors in the calculations for foreign exchange risk. Risk factor sensitivities should be calculated using valuation models used for financial reporting purposes, and all risk factor sensitivities should be calculated in the reporting currency, except for foreign exchange risk where a base currency may be used with approval. The delta capital requirement would be calculated based on the proposed sensitivity definitions, reflecting the change in value of a position resulting from a small specified shift in a risk factor.
