The agencies are proposing to use the existing definition of qualified residential mortgage to identify residential mortgage-backed securities that have low credit risk. They are also proposing to define sub-prime residential mortgage-backed securities as those primarily consisting of higher-priced mortgage loans. The agencies are considering using loan price rather than borrower characteristics to identify the subprime market. The proposal would reduce compliance burden for banking organizations by leveraging criteria already used to evaluate mortgage loans. The agencies are seeking comments on the appropriateness of the proposed definitions and any operational challenges they may pose.
