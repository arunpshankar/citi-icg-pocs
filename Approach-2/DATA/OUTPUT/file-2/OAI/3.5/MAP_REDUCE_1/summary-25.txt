The proposal aims to establish minimum haircut floors for certain transactions conducted by banking organizations with unregulated financial institutions. These transactions, which involve lending cash or borrowing securities, would be exempt from the minimum haircut floors as they do not pose the same credit and liquidity risks. The application of the minimum haircut floors would depend on whether the transaction is a single transaction or part of a netting set. The minimum haircut floors are intended to ensure that banking organizations receive an appropriate amount of collateral to account for the risks involved. The proposal would require banking organizations to compare the haircut and the applicable minimum haircut floor to determine if the transaction meets the requirements.
