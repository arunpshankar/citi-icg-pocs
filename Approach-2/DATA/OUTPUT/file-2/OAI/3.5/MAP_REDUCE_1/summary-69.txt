The agencies are seeking comments on the appropriateness of allowing banking organizations to net the gross default exposures of derivative contracts and underlying positions.

The agencies are seeking comments on the treatment of GSE exposures and alternative methods for measuring default risk. They are also asking for feedback on not allowing banking organizations to recognize offsetting benefits for market risk covered positions where the obligor is not identified. The proposed rule provides risk buckets and corresponding risk weights for non-securitization debt or equity positions, based on counterparty type and credit quality. The agencies are proposing default risk buckets for non-securitization positions that are generally consistent with Basel III reforms but defined using alternative criteria.

The agencies are seeking comments on the proposed netting and decomposition criteria for securitization positions and alternative methodologies for capturing hedging benefits and basis risk. The proposal also defines risk bucket structures for securitization positions based on asset class and region, and the risk weights are based on those calculated for securitization exposures
