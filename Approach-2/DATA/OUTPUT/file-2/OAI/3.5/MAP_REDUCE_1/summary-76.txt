The primary Federal supervisor has the authority to determine if data inputs for calculating the IMCC are unsuitable, even if they pass the eligibility test and data quality requirements. Banking organizations may face challenges in meeting the proposed data quality requirements for modellable risk factors. The agencies are seeking comments on additional requirements to ensure accurate calculation of potential losses from modellable risk factors. Requiring banking organizations to update data inputs for the IMCC on a weekly basis may pose challenges, and concerns can be mitigated by ensuring data integrity. Re-estimating parameters in line with policies and procedures may also pose challenges for banking organizations. The operational burden of modeling idiosyncratic risk for issuers can be reduced by allowing the use of data from similar names, but there are benefits and drawbacks to consider.
