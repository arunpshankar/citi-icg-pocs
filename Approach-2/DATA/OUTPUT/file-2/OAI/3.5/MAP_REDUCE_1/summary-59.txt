The proposed method for calculating market risk capital requirements involves assigning risk buckets to market risk covered positions and mapping them to specific risk factors. The risk factors reflect the market variables that impact the value of a position. Sensitivity calculations for delta, vega, and curvature risk factors are used to estimate how much a position's value might change due to a specified change in the risk factor. Risk weights are applied to capture the potential movement of risk factors during stress conditions. Aggregation formulas are used to calculate the total capital requirements for delta, vega, and curvature risk within and across risk buckets and classes. Correlation parameters are used to account for interactions between risk factors, and different correlation scenarios are considered to calculate overall capital requirements. The sensitivities-based method is being proposed to capture the risks of positions subject to the market risk capital requirement, but commenters are invited to provide feedback and suggest any additional features or adjustments that could improve the method.
