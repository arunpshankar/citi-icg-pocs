The proposal requires banking organizations to calculate the exposure amount for derivative exposures held by an investment fund using a formula that includes the replacement cost and potential future exposure. The proposal also provides factors to be multiplied based on the counterparty and whether the derivative contracts qualify as a CVA risk covered position. For equity exposures to other investment funds, the proposal requires proportional risk-weighted assets to be determined based on the hierarchy of approaches. Subsequent indirect equity exposure layers generally require a 1,250 percent risk weight, unless the full look-through approach can be applied. The proposal also introduces a standardized approach for operational risk capital requirement.
