The proposed SEC-SA approach would require a risk-weight floor of at least 100 percent for resecuritization exposures, due to their complexity and correlation risks. NPL securitization exposures would also have a minimum risk weight of 100 percent, reflecting the higher risks involved. Exceptions to the risk-based capital treatment for securitization exposures would be included to account for unique features and ensure appropriate capital requirements. These exceptions include nth-to-default credit derivatives and derivative contracts that do not provide credit enhancements. The proposal also introduces provisions for overlapping exposures, allowing banking organizations to treat non-overlapping exposures as overlapping and recognize overlaps between market risk covered and noncovered positions. Lastly, a look-through approach would be introduced for senior securitization exposures, capping the risk weight at the weighted-average risk weight of the underlying exposures.
