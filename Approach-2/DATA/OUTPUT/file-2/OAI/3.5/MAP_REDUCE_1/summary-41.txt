Under the proposal, banking organizations would include operational loss events from acquired or merged entities in their calculation of total net operational losses. If historical loss data is not available for these entities, a formula would be provided to calculate annual total net operational losses for the missing years. The proposal recognizes that obtaining historical data for operational losses may be difficult in certain circumstances. Banking organizations with deficient loss collection practices may face higher capital requirements. Banking organizations can request supervisory approval to exclude operational loss events that are no longer relevant to their risk profile, but they must provide adequate justification. Divestitures may also allow for the exclusion of historical operational loss events, depending on the presence of legacy legal exposure. The agencies would only consider exclusions after operational losses have been included for at least three years, and the excluded losses must be equal to five percent or more of the banking organization's average annual total net operational losses.
