The formula for calculating gross exposure is the sum of the absolute value of the net position in a given instrument or gold, multiplied by the appropriate haircut. The number of instruments in the netting set is denoted by N and includes any instrument with a unique identifier that the banking organization lends, sells, borrows, or purchases. The net exposure component recognizes netting and correlations in market prices, while the gross exposure component captures the impact of portfolio diversification. Currency mismatch is accounted for by adjusting the exposure amount. Market price volatility haircuts are applied based on the type of collateral and its residual maturity. The proposed methodology aims to balance simplicity and risk sensitivity.
