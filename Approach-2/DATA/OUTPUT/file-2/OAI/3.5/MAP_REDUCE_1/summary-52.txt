The proposed regulations require banking organizations to identify notional trading desks as part of their trading desk structure to ensure proper treatment of market risk covered positions. The agencies will review the trading desk structure, including notional trading desks, to ensure they have been appropriately identified. Additional requirements may be applied to notional trading desks to clarify the level at which market risk capital requirements must be calculated. Banking organizations must define their trading desk structure, including model-eligible and model-ineligible trading desks, trading desks used for internal risk transfers, and notional trading desks. Policies and procedures must be established for each trading desk, describing the strategy and risk management framework. Operational requirements for active management of market risk covered positions, stress testing, control and oversight, and documentation will be maintained and revised to support the proposed requirements. The proposal also aims to strengthen a banking organization's prudent valuation practices and promote effective model risk management.
