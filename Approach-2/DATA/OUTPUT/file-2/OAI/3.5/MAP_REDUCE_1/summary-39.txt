The financial component of a banking organization captures trading activities and other associated assets and liabilities. It includes trading revenue and net profit or loss on assets and liabilities not held for trading. Expenses unrelated to financial services are excluded, but operational loss events are included. Loss provisions, changes in goodwill, and income taxes are not included. Banking organizations can exclude ceased activities with supervisory approval. The business indicator component increases at different rates based on the banking organization's business indicator. The internal loss multiplier increases operational risk capital requirements based on historical operational loss experience.
