1. When calculating delta sensitivity for positions with optionality, a banking organization can use the sticky strike rule, sticky delta rule, or another approved assumption.
2. The vega sensitivity for market risk covered positions with optionality is calculated by multiplying the vega of an option by the volatility of the option.
3. Callable and puttable bonds priced based on yield to maturity are exempt from the vega capital requirement.
4. Options without a stated strike price or with multiple strike prices are valued based on internal pricing models for financial reporting.
5. Curvature capital requirements capture price risks in instruments with optionality that are not captured by delta, and only options or positions with embedded optionality are subject to this requirement.
