The proposal aims to revise the risk-weight for publicly traded equity exposures with tradability restrictions. It suggests eliminating the 100 percent risk weight for non-significant equity exposures and introducing a 250 percent risk weight for all publicly traded equity exposures with restrictions on tradability. The proposal also addresses equity exposures to investment firms with greater than immaterial leverage and that would meet the definition of a traditional securitization. It suggests increasing the risk weight for such exposures from 600 percent to 1,250 percent. The proposal includes due diligence requirements for equity exposures to investment firms treated as traditional securitizations. It also introduces a hierarchy of look-through approaches for equity exposures to investment funds based on the availability and quality of information.
