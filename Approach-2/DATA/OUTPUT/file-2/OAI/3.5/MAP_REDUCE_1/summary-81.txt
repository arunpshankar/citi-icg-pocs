The proposal aims to improve the PLA test metrics for model-eligible trading desks. The test metrics include the Spearman correlation and the Kolmogorov-Smirnov metric. The Spearman correlation measures the correlation between risk-theoretical profit and loss and hypothetical profit and loss. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov metric assesses the similarity of the distribution of portfolio values generated by internal risk management models and front office models. Based on the test results, trading desks are allocated to different zones (green, amber, or red). The proposal also introduces the PLA add-on, which is calculated based on the capital benefit from the internal models approach.
