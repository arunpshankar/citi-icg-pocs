The proposal introduces changes to risk-based capital requirements for credit valuation adjustment (CVA) risk. It includes a formula to calculate the risk-based capital requirement under the BA-CVA, which is a simpler and less risk-sensitive method compared to the SA-CVA. The formula takes into account the risk mitigating effect of eligible CVA hedges. The proposal also introduces a regulatory correlation parameter to approximate the correlation between credit spreads of counterparties. It sets supervisory risk weights for each counterparty based on their sector and credit quality. The proposal aligns with the Basel III reforms and includes specific treatment for certain U.S.-specific counterparties.
