The Board is proposing changes to reporting requirements for TLAC risk-weighted asset buffer, Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (AOCI), regulatory capital deductions, market risk RWAs, and operational risk. The proposed changes aim to align reporting standards and provide more insight into risk exposures. The Board is also proposing revisions to the definition of operational loss events and the reporting of timing losses. These changes would apply to banking organizations subject to expanded risk-based standards. The proposed revisions seek to improve data consistency and comparability across all banking organizations.
