The information provided discusses the calculation of curvature risk-weighted sensitivity for different risk classes. It explains that for interest rate, credit spread, and commodity risk classes, upward and downward shocks are applied assuming a parallel shift of all tenors for each curve. The proposal requires banking organizations to apply the highest risk weight across risk buckets to each tenor point along the curve. The calculation is performed at the risk bucket level. Negative credit spreads are floored at zero. For foreign exchange and equity risk classes, relative shifts of spot prices are used. Positions with negative curvature represent a capital benefit and are included in the calculation. The proposed risk weight buckets and associated risk weights aim to capture specific risks and promote consistency among banking organizations. Separate interest rate risk buckets are established for each currency. Banking organizations can divide the risk weight for liquid currencies by the square root of two.
