The proposal suggests that interest rate curves for different currencies and reference rates should be treated as distinct curves due to basis risk. Onshore and offshore currency curves should also be treated separately, unless approved by the primary Federal supervisor. Additional risk factors should be considered for instruments dependent on inflation or different currencies. Vega risk factors for interest rate risk would be implied volatilities of options, while curvature risk factors would be defined along the interest rate curve. The proposal also defines risk factors for credit spread, equity, and commodity risks.
