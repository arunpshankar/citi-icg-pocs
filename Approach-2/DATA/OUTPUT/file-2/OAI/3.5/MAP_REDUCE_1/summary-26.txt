The information provided discusses the minimum haircut floor for a portfolio of repo-style transactions. If the portfolio does not meet the minimum haircut floor, the banking organization cannot recognize the risk-mitigating benefits of the collateral received. The example given includes two transactions with different collateral and corresponding haircut floors. The portfolio haircut is calculated to determine if it meets the portfolio haircut floor. If it does, the banking organization can recognize the risk-mitigating benefits of the collateral. If it doesn't, the banking organization must separately risk-weight each individual transaction. The securitization framework is designed to provide capital requirements for exposures involving the tranching of credit risk. It includes operational requirements for synthetic securitizations and a modified treatment for resecuritizations. It also introduces a new securitization standardized approach and prohibits the use of the securitization framework for certain transactions.
