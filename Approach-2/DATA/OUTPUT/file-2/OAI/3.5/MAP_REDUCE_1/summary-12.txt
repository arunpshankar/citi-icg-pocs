The information provided discusses the risk weights for different types of real estate exposures based on their characteristics. For regulatory residential real estate exposures, the risk weight depends on factors such as whether the loan is secured by an owner-occupied or rented property and whether it meets prudent underwriting standards. For regulatory commercial real estate exposures, the risk weight is determined by whether the loan is primarily secured by completed real estate and whether it meets prudent underwriting standards. The risk weights also vary based on whether the exposure is dependent on the cash flows generated by the real estate. The proposal seeks feedback on the application of prudent underwriting standards and alternative quantitative thresholds for determining the dependence on cash flows.
