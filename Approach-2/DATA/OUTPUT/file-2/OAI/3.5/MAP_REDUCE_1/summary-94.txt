The proposal requires banking organizations to separately calculate risk-based capital requirements for delta and vega to capture linear CVA risks. Sensitivities to vega risk factors must always be measured, regardless of whether the positions include options. Risk classes for delta and vega include interest rate, foreign exchange, credit spread, equity, and commodity. Counterparty credit spread risk is treated as a separate delta risk class. Sensitivities to risk factors are calculated by measuring the change in aggregate regulatory CVA and market value of eligible CVA hedges due to small changes in the risk factors. For positions referencing an index, sensitivities are calculated by applying the shift of the risk factor to all index constituents. Counterparty credit spread delta risk factors are defined as shifts in credit spreads for individual entities and qualified indices for various tenors. Sensitivities of counterparty credit spread hedges to the credit spread of each constituent entity must also be calculated.
