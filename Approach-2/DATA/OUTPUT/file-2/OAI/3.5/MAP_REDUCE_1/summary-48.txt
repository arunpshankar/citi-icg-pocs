The proposed definition of market risk covered position includes certain transactions of internal risk transfers and excludes certain positions such as intangible assets, certain equity positions, and direct real estate holdings. The proposal also excludes debt securities for which the banking organization elects the fair value option and instruments held for hedging purposes. The agencies seek comment on the appropriateness of the proposed definition and the practical challenges it may pose for banking organizations. They also seek input on the inclusion of equity positions in investment funds and the exclusion of investments in capital instruments or covered debt instruments of financial institutions. Additionally, the agencies seek feedback on the proposed measures for identifying net short risk positions and the $20 million threshold for capitalization. They also ask for comments on the challenges in calculating the market risk capital requirement for net short risk positions and potential alternatives to the total commitment for loans. Finally, the agencies seek input on the exclusion for debt instruments used for asset and liability management purposes.
