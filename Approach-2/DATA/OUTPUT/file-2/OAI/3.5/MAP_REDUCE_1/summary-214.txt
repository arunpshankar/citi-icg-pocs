FDIC-supervised institutions subject to subpart E of this regulation must deduct non-significant investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions and investments in covered debt instruments that exceed the 10 percent threshold. These deductions are net of associated deferred tax liabilities. However, with prior approval from the FDIC, institutions underwriting failed underwritings are not required to deduct non-significant investments or investments related to the failed underwriting. FDIC-supervised institutions that are not subject to subpart E must also make deductions from regulatory capital as described in the regulation. The deductions include items such as DTAs, MSAs, and significant investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions. If an institution does not have enough of a specific capital component to make the required deductions, the shortfall amount must be deducted from the next higher component of regulatory capital.
