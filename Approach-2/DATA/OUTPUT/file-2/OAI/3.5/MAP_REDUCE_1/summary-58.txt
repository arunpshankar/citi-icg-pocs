The proposal requires prior approval from the primary Federal supervisor to use an alternative method to quantify the market risk capital requirement for derivative positions. The fair value of derivative positions may underestimate the exposure, so alternative methodologies for the fallback capital requirements are being considered. The proposal introduces a capital add-on requirement as a penalty for re-designating positions, with exceptions for circumstances outside of the banking organization's control. The capital add-on is calculated by comparing the total capital requirements before and after the re-designation. The proposal also includes a sensitivities-based method for calculating the standardized measure for market risk, which involves assigning positions to risk buckets and determining the sensitivity to prescribed risk factors.
