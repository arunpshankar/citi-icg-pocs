The proposal suggests implementing a lower capital multiplier for banking organizations based on the number of exceptions in their backtesting results. This is to measure the conservatism of forecasting assumptions and valuation methods used for determining risk-based capital requirements. A high number of exceptions could indicate modeling issues and warrant increased capital requirements. The proposal also includes a PLA add-on, which imposes an additional capital requirement on model-eligible trading desks with deficiencies in their internal models. The add-on provides incentives for trading desks to address data and model deficiencies. The proposal requires banking organizations to compare the daily profit and loss values produced by their internal risk management models against the hypothetical profit and loss produced by front office models. It also allows for alignment of risk factor input data and includes flexibility in treating time effects. Additionally, the proposal allows for the inclusion of securitization positions for the purposes of the PLA tests.
