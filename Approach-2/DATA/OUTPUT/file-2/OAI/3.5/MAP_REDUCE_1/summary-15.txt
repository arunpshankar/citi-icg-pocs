1. Evaluating defaulted residential mortgage exposures at the obligor level may be difficult for banking organizations due to challenges in collecting information on payment status of other obligations of individual borrowers.
2. Default by an obligor on other credit obligations indicates increased credit risk of the exposure held by a banking organization.
3. A defaulted real estate exposure that is a residential mortgage exposure includes exposures that are 90 days or more past due, where the banking organization has taken a partial charge-off or write-down, or where a distressed restructuring has occurred.
4. Non-residential real estate exposures that meet the criteria for defaulted exposure should be treated as such until the obligor meets the definition of investment grade or speculative grade.
5. ADC exposures that are not HVCRE exposures would be assigned a 100 percent risk weight, while other real estate exposures would be assigned a 150 percent risk weight unless they are residential mortgage exposures not dependent on the cash flows generated by the real estate.
