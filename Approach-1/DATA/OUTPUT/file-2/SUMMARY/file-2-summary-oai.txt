The document provides a comprehensive discussion on the treatment of derivative contracts, particularly those not cleared through a Qualified Central Counterparty (QCCP). It outlines the rules for cash collateral, variation margin, and the governing agreements for derivative contracts. Cash collateral received by the recipient counterparty is not segregated unless required by law, regulation, or an agreement with the counterparty. Variation margin is calculated and transferred daily based on the mark-to-fair value of the derivative contract. The transferred variation margin should be enough to fully extinguish the net current credit exposure to the counterparty, subject to the threshold and minimum transfer amounts applicable to the counterparty. The derivative contract and the variation margin should be governed by a qualifying master netting agreement between the legal entities that are the counterparties to the derivative contract or by the governing rules for a cleared transaction.

Section 1: Supervisory Delta Adjustment and Hedging Set Amounts
The document discusses the supervisory delta adjustment for derivative contracts that are option contracts. The adjustment is determined by formulas in Table 1, with variables defined within the document. The same value of ฮป must be used for all option contracts referencing the same underlying risk factor or instrument, or for all interest rate option contracts denominated in the same currency. The document provides mathematical formulas for calculating the hedging set amounts for different types of derivative contracts. The formulas use variables representing the sum of the adjusted derivative contract amounts within the hedging set with an end date of less than one year, one to five years, and more than five years from the present date, respectively.

Section 2: Treatment of Derivative Contracts and Credit Valuation Adjustment
The document proposes that banking organizations should assume that the seniority of derivative contracts is equivalent to that of senior unsecured bonds. If the derivative contracts' seniority differs, the banking organization can adjust the Expected Loss Given Default (ELGD) to reflect the varying losses from such exposures. However, the proposal prohibits using collateral as a reason for changing the ELGD. The proposal also aligns the regulatory Credit Valuation Adjustment (CVA) with industry practices. The Standardized Approach for Counterparty Credit Risk (SA-CVA) calculation would be based on the exposure models used by the banking organization for financial reporting.

Section 3: Revisions to Definitions and Calculations Related to Credit Derivatives
The document provides instructions for revising definitions and calculations related to credit derivatives. The definition for "Eligible credit derivative" is revised to state that the derivative contract must meet the requirements of paragraphs (1) through (9) of an eligible guarantee, as defined in ยง 3.2 of this chapter. This must be confirmed by both the protection purchaser and provider. In ยง 32.9, revisions are made to paragraphs (b)(1)(i)(C), (b)(1)(iv), (c)(1)(i), and (c)(1)(iii). Notably, the calculation of potential future credit exposure is addressed.

Section 4: Maturity Factor and Treatment of Binary Options
The document discusses the calculation of the maturity factor for a derivative contract that is not subject to a variation margin agreement. The formula for the maturity factor is the minimum of 250 and the square root of M divided by 250, where M is the greater of 10 business days and the remaining maturity of the contract. If a banking organization chooses to treat a cleared transaction that is not subject to a variation margin agreement as one that is, the derivative contract must be treated as subject to a variation margin agreement with the maturity factor determined according to the specified section. The document also states that a banking organization must separate a derivative contract into separate derivative contracts. Specifically, a binary option where the counterparty pays a predetermined amount if the value of the underlying asset is above or below the strike price must be treated as two separate options. This binary option with strike price K should be represented as the combination of one bought European option and one sold European option of the same type as the original option with the strike prices set equal to 0.95 * K and 1.05 * K.

Section 5: Treatment of Various Types of Derivative Contracts
The document discusses the treatment of various types of derivative contracts by a banking organization. For a derivative contract that can be represented as a combination of standard option payoffs (like collar, butterfly spread, calendar spread, straddle, and strangle), each standard option component must be treated as a separate derivative contract. For contracts that include multiple-payment options (like interest rate caps and floors), each payment option can be represented as a combination of effective single-payment options (like interest rate caplets and floorlets). However, linear derivative contracts (like swaps) cannot be decomposed into components. The document also provides a formula for calculating the replacement cost for multiple netting sets subject to a single variation margin agreement. The replacement cost is calculated as the sum of the positive values of each netting set subject to the variation margin agreement.

Section 6: Categorization and Treatment of Derivative Contracts for Risk Management
The document discusses the categorization and treatment of various types of derivative contracts for risk management purposes. It specifies that commodity derivative contracts within a netting set should reference one of the following categories: Energy, metal, agricultural, or other commodities. Basis derivative contracts within a netting set should reference the same pair of risk factors and be denominated in the same currency. Volatility derivative contracts within a netting set should reference one of the following risk factors: interest rate, exchange rate, credit, equity, or commodity, and be separated according to specific requirements. If a derivative contract's risk significantly depends on more than one risk factor, the agency may require the banking organization to include the contract in each appropriate hedging set. For credit derivatives, a banking organization that purchases a credit derivative recognized as a credit risk mitigant for an exposure that is not a market risk covered position is not required to calculate a separate counterparty credit risk capital requirement, provided it does so consistently for all such credit derivatives. This is subject to the condition that it either includes all or excludes all such credit derivatives subject to a master netting agreement from any measure used to determine counterparty credit risk exposure for risk-based capital purposes.

Section 7: Calculation of Adjusted Notional Amount and Supervisory Delta Adjustment
The document provides a comprehensive overview of the calculation of the adjusted notional amount for various types of derivative contracts held by a banking organization. In the case of an exchange rate derivative contract with multiple exchanges of principal, the adjusted notional amount is determined by multiplying the notional amount of the derivative contract by the number of exchanges of principal under the contract. For equity or commodity derivative contracts, the adjusted notional amount is calculated as the product of the fair value of one unit of the reference instrument underlying the contract and the number of such units referenced by the contract. However, for a volatility derivative contract, the unit price is replaced with the underlying volatility referenced by the contract and the number of units is replaced with the notional amount of the volatility derivative contract. The document also delves into the supervisory delta adjustment for derivative contracts. For a contract that is not an option contract or collateralized debt obligation tranche, the supervisory delta adjustment is 1 if the fair value of the contract increases when the value of the primary risk factor increases, and -1 if the fair value of the contract decreases when the value of the primary risk factor increases.

Section 8: Treatment of Securitization Exposures
The proposal introduces a new treatment for certain interest rate or foreign exchange derivative contracts that qualify as securitization exposures. These securitizations may make payments in a different currency or at a fixed rate when the cash flows from the securitized assets are linked to a floating interest rate. To mitigate these risks, the securitization SPE may enter into a derivative contract that mirrors the currency or interest rate mismatch. The proposal mandates a banking organization acting as a counterparty to these derivatives to set the risk weight equal to the risk weight calculated under the SEC-SA for a securitization exposure that is pari passu to the derivative contract or, if such an exposure does not exist, the risk weight of the next subordinated tranche. This is due to the potential inability to calculate a risk weight using the SEC-SA as the attachment and detachment points could equal one another, making the formula inoperable. The current capital rule allows banking organizations to assign a risk-weighted asset amount for certain derivative contracts that are securitization exposures equal to the exposure amount of the derivative contract (a risk weight of 100 percent). The proposed treatment aims to reflect the credit risk associated with these derivative contracts being commensurate with or less than the credit risk associated with a pari passu tranche or the next subordinated tranche of a securitization exposure.
