2. The proposal would define trading desk as a unit of organization of a banking organization that purchases or sells market risk covered positions and satisfies three requirements.


3. The proposed trading desk definition is intended to help ensure that a banking organization structures its trading desks to capture the level at which trading activities are managed and operated and at which the profit and loss of the trading strategy is attributed.
