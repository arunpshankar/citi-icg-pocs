 1. The agencies propose a standardized approach to calculating market risk capital 
requirements. 
2. The standardized approach would replace the current VaR-based measure with an expected shortfall measure to capture tail risk. 
3. The proposal also would limit the regulatory capital benefit of hedging and portfolio diversification across different asset classes. 
4. The agencies seek comment on all aspects of the models-based measure for market risk calculation, including the capital requirement for instances where the capital requirement under the internal models approach for model-eligible desks exceeds the amount required for such desks under the standardized approach. 
5. For purposes of calculating the standardized measure for market risk, the proposal would require a banking organization to apply the fallback capital requirement to each of the affected positions and exclude such positions from the standardized approach capital requirement.
