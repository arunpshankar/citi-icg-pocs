 1. The proposal introduces a look-through approach for senior securitization exposures with a 15% floor.


2. The risk weight for a senior securitization exposure would be the lower of the risk weight calculated under the SEC-SA and 100%.


3. A banking organization would be required to deduct from common equity tier 1 capital any portion of a CEIO strip that does not constitute an after-tax gain on the sale.


4. The proposal defines an NPL securitization as a securitization whose underlying exposures consist solely of loans where parameter W for the underlying pool is greater than or equal to 90 percent.


5. A banking organization would be required to assign a risk weight of 100 percent to a securitization exposure to an NPL securitization if the transaction structure meets the definition of a traditional securitization, the securitization has a credit enhancement in the form of a nonrefundable purchase price discount greater than or equal to 50 percent of the outstanding balance of the pool of exposures, and the banking organization's exposure is a senior securitization exposure.
