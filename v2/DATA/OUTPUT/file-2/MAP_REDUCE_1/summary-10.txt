 1. The proposal introduces a risk-based approach to assigning risk weights to bank exposures, with three categories of bank exposures (Grade A, B, and C) based on the obligor's creditworthiness and publicly disclosed capital ratios. 
2. Grade A bank exposure is assigned a 40% risk weight, Grade B 75%, and Grade C 150%. 
3. The proposal also includes a risk weight floor for foreign bank exposures based on the risk weight applicable to a sovereign exposure for the jurisdiction where the foreign bank is incorporated. 
4. Subordinated debt instruments are defined and assigned a risk weight of 100%. 
5. The proposal addresses concerns around procyclicality by incorporating publicly disclosed capital levels in the determination of each of the three categories of bank exposures.
