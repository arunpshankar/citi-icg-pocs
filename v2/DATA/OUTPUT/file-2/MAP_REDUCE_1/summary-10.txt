 1. The proposal introduces a risk-based approach to assigning risk weights to bank exposures, with three categories of bank exposures (Grade A, B, and C) based on the obligor's creditworthiness and publicly disclosed capital ratios. 
2. Grade A exposures receive a lower risk weight of 40%, while Grade B and C exposures receive higher risk weights of 75% and 150%, respectively. 
3. The proposal also includes a risk weight floor for foreign bank exposures based on the sovereign risk-weight floor. 
4. The proposal introduces a definition and explicit risk weight treatment for exposures in the form of subordinated debt instruments, which are assigned a risk weight of 100%. 
5. The proposal addresses concerns around procyclicality by incorporating publicly disclosed capital levels in the determination of each of the three categories of bank exposures.
