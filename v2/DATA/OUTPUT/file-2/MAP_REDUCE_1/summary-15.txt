 1. The proposed definition of defaulted real estate exposure is more specific and
comprehensive than banking organizations' existing policies. 
2. The proposal would require banking organizations to consider both the obligor and the parent
company or other entity or individual that owns or controls the obligor when determining if the
exposure meets the criteria for "defaulted real estate exposure". 
3. The proposal would include a borrower's bankruptcy as a criterion for defaulted real estate
exposure. 
4. ADC exposures that are not HVCRE exposures would be assigned a 100 percent risk weight
under the proposal. 
5. Other real estate exposures would be assigned a 150 percent risk weight, unless the exposure
is a residential mortgage exposure that is not dependent on the cash flows generated by the real
estate, which must be assigned a 100 percent risk weight.
