 1. The agencies propose an internal models approach for market risk capital requirements. 
2. The approach includes three components: modellable risk factors, non-modellable risk factors, and standardized default risk capital requirement. 
3. The capital requirement for modellable risk factors is the expected shortfall (ES) of the risk factor, multiplied by a capital multiplier of at least 1.5. 
4. The capital requirement for non-modellable risk factors is the sum of the standardized unexpected shortfall (SES) of the risk factor and the product of the average capital requirements for modellable risk factors over the prior 60 business days and a multiplication factor of at least 1.5. 
5. The overall capital requirement under the internal models approach is the sum of the capital requirements for modellable and non-modellable risk factors, plus the standardized default risk capital requirement.
