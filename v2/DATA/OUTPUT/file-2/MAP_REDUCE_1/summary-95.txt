 1. The proposal defines risk factors for counterparty credit spread risk, reference credit spread risk, equity risk, commodity risk, interest rate risk, and foreign exchange risk. 

2. For counterparty credit spread risk, the proposal defines risk factors for each constituent of the index and an optional approach for qualified indices. 

3. For market risk factors, the proposal defines risk factors for each risk class in a much less granular way than under the sensitivity-based method. 

4. The proposal defines risk buckets, risk weights, and correlations for the risk factors. 

5. The proposal reduces the granularity of risk factors and exposure-related risk classes to reduce the computational intensity of calculating CVA sensitivities.
