 1. The attachment point calculation would include noncash assets in a reserve account and exclude interest rate and foreign exchange derivatives. 


2. The definition of the W parameter would exclude underlying securitization exposures from the numerator for resecuritization exposures. 


3. The delinquency-adjusted (KA) and non-adjusted (KG) weighted-average capital requirement would be a function of KG and W. 


4. The supervisory parameter p would be 1.0 for securitization exposures that are not resecuritization exposures and 1.5 for resecuritization exposures. 


5. The SEC-SA would require banking organizations to apply a risk weight floor of 15 percent for securitization exposures that are not resecuritization exposures.
