 1. The proposal introduces a standardized approach for operational risk capital requirements, replacing the advanced measurement approaches. 


2. The standardized approach uses a business indicator component and an internal loss multiplier to determine the operational risk capital requirement. 


3. The business indicator component measures a banking organization's operational risk exposure and is based on a three-year rolling average of various financial statement items. 


4. The internal loss multiplier is based on the ratio of a banking organization's historical operational losses to its business indicator component and increases as historical operational losses increase. 


5. The proposal also includes definitions for total interest income, total interest expense, and dividend income.
