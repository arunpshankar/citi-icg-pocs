 1. The proposal expands the application of the countercyclical capital buffer and supplementary leverage ratio to banking organizations subject to Category IV capital standards.
2. The proposal would modify how the countercyclical capital buffer amount is determined to reflect the proposed changes to market risk capital requirements.
3. The proposal would also expand application of the supplementary leverage ratio requirement to banking organizations subject to Category IV capital standards.
4. The proposal would require large banking organizations to calculate total risk-weighted assets under two approaches: (1) the expanded risk-based approach, and (2) the standardized approach.
5. The proposal would introduce an "output floor" to the calculation of expanded total risk-weighted assets.
