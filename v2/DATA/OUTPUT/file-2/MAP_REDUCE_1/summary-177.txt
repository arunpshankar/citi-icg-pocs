 1. Delta risk factors and weights are assigned to counterparty credit spread risk and reference credit spread risk. 
2. Counterparty credit spread risk is divided into 7 buckets, while reference credit spread risk is divided into 17 buckets. 
3. Delta risk weights for counterparty credit spread risk range from 0.5% to 12%, while delta risk weights for reference credit spread risk range from 0.5% to 12%. 
4. Delta cross-bucket correlation parameters are provided for both counterparty credit spread risk and reference credit spread risk. 
5. The calculation of delta risk factors and weights is based on the sensitivity of the hedge to each index constituent.
