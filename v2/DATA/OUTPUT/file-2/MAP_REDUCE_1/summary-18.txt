 1. The agencies propose to define a project finance exposure as a corporate exposure for which the banking organization relies on the revenues generated by a single project as the source of repayment and as security for the loan. 


2. A project finance exposure would receive a 130 percent risk weight during the pre-operational phase and a 100 percent risk weight during the operational phase. 


3. The proposal would introduce updated credit conversion factors that a banking organization would apply to an off-balance sheet item's notional amount to calculate the exposure amount for an off-balance sheet exposure. 


4. The proposal would maintain the existing definition of commitment under the current capital rule and include an approach to calculate a proxy for the committed but undrawn amount of the commitment for commitments with no express contractual maximum amount or pre-set limit. 


5. The proposal would exclude from the definition of a project finance exposure exposures that are guaranteed by the government or considered a general obligation or revenue obligation exposure to a PSE.
