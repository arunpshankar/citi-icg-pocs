 1. The proposal requires banking organizations to include operational loss events incurred by acquired or merged entities in their calculation of total net operational losses. 
2.  A formula is provided for calculating annual total net operational losses for missing years for merged or acquired entities. 
3.  Banking organizations with five to nine years of loss data meeting the collection requirements would use as many years of loss data as available in the calculation. 
4.  The internal loss multiplier would equal one if the years of loss data are less than five, but the primary federal supervisor may require higher capital requirements if deemed insufficient. 
5.  Banking organizations may request supervisory approval to exclude operational loss events that are no longer relevant to their risk profile, subject to certain conditions.
