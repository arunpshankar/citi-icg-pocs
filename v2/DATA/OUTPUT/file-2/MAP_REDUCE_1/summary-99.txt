 1. The agencies propose an expanded risk-based capital framework that produces greater risk-weighted assets and becomes the binding approach for most large banking organizations. 


2. The new framework includes operational risk and CVA risk components, making large banking organizations more attuned to managing these risks. 


3. The proposal increases the binding common equity tier 1 capital requirement by an estimated 16 percent for large holding companies, with smaller increases for other depository institutions. 


4. While most large banking organizations already have enough capital to meet the proposed requirements, it would likely result in an increase in equity capital funding maintained by these organizations. 


5. The proposal's potential impact on lending is modest, with the benefits of a more resilient financial system outweighing any potential reduction in lending.
