 1. The expanded risk-based capital framework proposed by banking regulators in the United States would result in higher risk-weighted assets and capital requirements for large banking organizations.


2. The new framework would replace the current standardized approach as the binding risk-based approach for most large banks, making capital requirements more sensitive to their specific risks.


3. The proposal would increase the binding common equity tier 1 capital requirement by an estimated 16 percent for large holding companies, with smaller increases for other categories of depository institutions.


4. While most large banking organizations already have enough capital to meet the proposed requirements, it could lead to an increase in equity capital funding maintained by these organizations.


5. The agencies estimated that the proposal would increase risk-weighted assets associated with lending activities by $380 billion for holding companies subject to capital standards, but the benefits of a more resilient banking system outweigh the potential modest reduction in bank lending.
