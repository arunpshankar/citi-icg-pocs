 (v) For interest rate risk, use the correlation parameters in Table 2, with 99.9% for same tenor and curve, and 50% for cross-bucket correlation. 
(vi) For credit spread risk for non-securitizations, establish buckets along two dimensions: credit quality and sector, and use the risk weights in Table 3. 
(vii) For credit spread risk for non-securitizations within a bucket, use the correlation parameters in (iii). 
(viii) For equity risk, use the correlation parameters in Table 4. 
(ix) For commodity risk, use the correlation parameters in Table 5.
