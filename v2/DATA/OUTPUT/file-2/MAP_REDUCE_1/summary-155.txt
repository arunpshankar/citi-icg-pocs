 (v) For interest rate risk, use the correlation parameters in Table 2, with 99.9% for cross-currency basis risk. 
(vi) For credit spread risk for non-securitizations, establish buckets along two dimensions: credit quality and sector. 
(vii) Use the risk weights in Table 3 for credit spread risk for non-securitizations. 
(viii) For credit spread risk for non-securitizations within a bucket, use the correlation parameters in (iii). 
(ix) For delta bucket-level risk positions across buckets within the credit spread risk class, the cross-bucket correlation parameter Ybc equals 50%.
