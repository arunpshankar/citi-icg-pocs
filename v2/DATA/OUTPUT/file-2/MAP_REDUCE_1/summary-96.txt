 1. The SA-CVA would assign one delta (and, separately, one vega) risk factor per risk bucket for the foreign exchange, reference credit spread, equity, and commodity risk classes.


2. For the interest rate risk class, the SA-CVA would have two groups of risk buckets/currencies: the "specified" currencies (USD, EUR, GBP, AUD, CAD, SEK, and JPY) and the other currencies.


3. The risk weights for counterparty credit spread risk factors under the SA-CVA would exactly match those for reference credit spread delta risk factors.


4. The proposal would merge the investment grade bucket and speculative and sub-speculative grade bucket of each sector into a single bucket for the counterparty credit spread risk class.


5. The proposal would merge the sovereign exposures and MDBs sector and the PSE, government-backed non-financials, GSE debt, education, and public administration sector into a single risk bucket for the counterparty credit spread risk class.
