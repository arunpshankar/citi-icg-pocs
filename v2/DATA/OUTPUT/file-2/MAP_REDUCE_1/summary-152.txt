 (i) k is a given risk factor;
(ii) vega is the vega sensitivity of the option to the given risk factor; and
(iii) volatility is the volatility of the option.
(2) A [BANKING ORGANIZATION] must calculate the vega sensitivity for interest rate
risk by changing the volatility of the option by one percentage point (0.01 in relative terms) and
dividing the resulting change in the value of the market risk covered position, Vį, by 0.01 as
follows:
where,
Sk =
Vi (volatility +0.01) - Vi (volatility)
0.01
(i) k is a given risk factor;
(ii) i is a given market risk covered position; and
(iii) Vi is the value of the market risk covered position i as a function of the volatility of the
option.
