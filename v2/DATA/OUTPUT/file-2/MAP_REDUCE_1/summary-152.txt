 The proposed rule requires banking organizations to calculate and report delta and vega sensitivities and curvature scenarios for market risk covered positions. 

The delta sensitivity measures the change in the value of a market risk covered position for a one basis point change in the relevant risk factor, such as interest rate, credit spread, equity spot price, equity repo rate, commodity spot price, or foreign exchange rate. 

The vega sensitivity measures the change in the value of a market risk covered position for a one percentage point change in the volatility of the option. 

The curvature scenarios measure the change in the value of a market risk covered position for a given change in the relevant risk factor. 

The sensitivities and curvature scenarios must be calculated with respect to the spread of the tranche rather than the spread of the underlying position for securitization positions non-CTP and with respect to the underlying names of the securitization position or nth-to-default position for correlation trading positions.
