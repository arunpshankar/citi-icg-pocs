 The agencies are proposing a market risk capital framework that requires banking organizations to adequately document all material aspects of their identification, management, and valuation of market risk covered positions. 
The proposal also includes additional operational requirements for the models-based measure for market risk, such as requiring trading desks to satisfy certain additional operational requirements to ensure they have allocated sufficient resources to develop and rely on internal models that appropriately capture market risk. 
The proposal would require eligibility for use of the internal models approach to be determined at the trading desk level, rather than for the entire banking organization. 
To help ensure that internal models appropriately capture a model-eligible trading desk's market risk exposure on an ongoing basis, the proposal would require banking organizations to satisfy additional model review and validation standards for model-eligible trading desks. 
The proposal also would require banking organizations to establish a validation process that at a minimum includes an evaluation of the internal models' conceptual soundness and adequacy in appropriately capturing and reflecting all material risks.
