 1. The proposed methodology for calculating the exposure amount for eligible margin loans and repo-style transactions covered by a QMNA has the advantage of capturing the baseline exposure of a netting set of eligible margin loans or repo-style transactions after accounting for the value of any collateral. 
2. The proposed methodology also has the advantage of reflecting the systematic risk (based on the net exposure) and the idiosyncratic risk (based on the gross exposure) of the netting set of eligible margin loans or repo-style transactions covered by a QMNA. 
3. The proposed methodology also has the advantage of allowing the formula to recognize netting at the level of the netting set and correlations in the movement of market prices for instruments lent and received. 
4. The proposed methodology also has the advantage of capturing any adjustment to reflect currency mismatch, if applicable. 
5. The proposed methodology has the disadvantage of being complex and may be difficult for some banking organizations to implement.
