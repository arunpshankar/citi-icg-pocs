 1. The delta sensitivity for positions with optionality is calculated using the sticky strike rule, sticky delta rule, or another assumption approved by the primary Federal supervisor. 


2. The vega sensitivity is calculated as the vega of an option multiplied by the volatility of the option. 


3. The vega capital requirement only applies to options or instruments with embedded optionality, including instruments with material prepayment risk. 


4. The curvature capital requirement is intended to capture the price risks inherent in instruments with optionality that are not already captured by delta. 


5. The proposal would require a banking organization to use the same risk buckets applied in the delta capital calculation to calculate curvature capital requirements.
