 1. VNS is the sum of the fair values of derivative contracts within a netting set, excluding valuation adjustments.
2. CMA is the sum of the net independent collateral amount and variation margin amount for derivative contracts subject to a single variation margin agreement.
3. Potential future exposure is calculated for netting sets subject to a single variation margin agreement, where the counterparty must post variation margin equal to the sum of the potential future exposure of each netting set.
4. Replacement cost for netting sets subject to multiple variation margin agreements or hybrid netting sets is calculated using the sum of the variation margin thresholds and minimum transfer amounts of all variation margin agreements within the netting set.
5. Risk-weighted assets for cleared transactions are calculated using the trade exposure amount multiplied by the risk weight appropriate for the cleared transaction.
