 1. The initial hypothetical (IH) is the sum of the expected shortfalls of each index hedge, where each term is a product of the risk weight, minimum binding default probability, and the notional amount of the index hedge. 
2. The supervisory risk weight for each index hedge is adjusted based on the constituents of the index, with a 0.7 factor applied to recognize diversification. 
3. The standardized approach for CVA risk (SA-CVA) is an adaptation of the sensitivities-based method used in the standardized measure for market risk, with some exceptions. 
4. Regulatory CVA is the sum of counterparty-level regulatory CVAs, which is an estimate of the market expectation of future loss in the event of a counterparty's default. 
5. The proposal requires the use of market-implied PD, market-consensus ELGD, and simulated paths of discounted future exposure in calculating regulatory CVA.
