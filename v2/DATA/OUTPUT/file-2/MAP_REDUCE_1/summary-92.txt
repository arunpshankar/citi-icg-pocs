 1. The market risk of index hedges is calculated by using the expected shortfall formula, which includes the sum of the risk-weighted supervisory risk weights for each index hedge. 
2. The standardized approach for CVA risk (SA-CVA) is an adaptation of the sensitivities-based method used in the standardized measure for market risk. 
3. The SA-CVA would closely follow the sensitivities-based method for market risk with some exceptions, including reflecting capital requirements for only delta and vega (but not curvature), applying slightly different steps in the calculation of the risk-weighted net sensitivity, using less granular risk factors and risk buckets, and including a capital multiplier to account for model risk. 
4. Regulatory CVA would require simulating future exposure that depends on multiple market risk factors over long time horizons, and the SA-CVA would use the same risk buckets, regulatory risk weight calibrations, and correlation parameters as are used in the sensitivities-based method for market risk, with necessary adjustments for the SA-CVA's reduced granularity of market risk factors. 
5. Counterparty-level regulatory CVA is intended to reflect an estimate of the market expectation of future loss that a banking organization would incur on its portfolio of derivatives
