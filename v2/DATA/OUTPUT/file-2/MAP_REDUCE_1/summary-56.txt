 1. The agencies propose a standardized approach to calculating market risk capital requirements, replacing the current internal models approach. 
2. The standardized measure for market risk consists of three main components: sensitivities-based method, standardized default risk capital requirement, and residual risk add-on. 
3. The proposal also includes three additional components that would apply in more limited instances to specific positions: fallback capital requirement, capital add-on for re-designations, and any additional capital requirement established by the primary Federal supervisor. 
4. The agencies view the proposed standardized measure for market risk as sufficiently risk sensitive to serve as a credible floor to the models-based measure for market risk. 
5. The primary Federal supervisor may require a banking organization to calculate capital requirements for specific positions or categories of positions under either subpart D or E instead of under subpart F of the capital rule, or under subpart F instead of under subpart D or E of the capital rule, or under both subpart F and subpart D or E, as applicable, to more appropriately reflect the risks of the positions.
