 1. Delta sensitivities are assigned to different buckets based on the type of risk (equity, commodity, or foreign exchange), and the risk weight for each bucket is specified. 

2. For equity risk, delta sensitivities are further categorized into 13 buckets based on market capitalization and liquidity, and the correlation between delta sensitivities within a bucket is determined based on the Pkl parameter. 

3. For commodity risk, delta sensitivities are assigned to 11 buckets based on the commodity type, and the correlation between delta sensitivities within a bucket is determined using the Pkl parameter and the intra-bucket correlation parameters from Table 10. 

4. For foreign exchange risk, delta sensitivities are assigned to buckets based on the exchange rate between the currency of the market risk covered position and the reporting currency, and the correlation between delta sensitivities within a bucket is determined using the Pkl parameter. 

5. The cross-bucket correlation parameter Ybc is used to aggregate delta bucket-level risk positions across buckets within a risk class.
