 1. The risk-weighted asset amount for an equity exposure to an investment fund held by another investment fund is determined using either the full look-through approach, the alternative modified look-through approach, or a 1,250 percent risk weight.

2. The risk-weighted assets for operational risk equals the operational risk capital requirement multiplied by 12.5.

3. The operational risk capital requirement equals the Business Indicator Component multiplied by the Internal Loss Multiplier.

4. The Business Indicator Component is calculated based on the interest, lease, and dividend component; the services component; and the financial component.

5. The Internal Loss Multiplier is calculated using a formula that includes the average annual total net operational losses and the Business Indicator Component.
