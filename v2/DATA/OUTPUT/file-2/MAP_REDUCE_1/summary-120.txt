 1. The formulas for calculating the hedging set amount for different types of derivative contracts are provided. 
2. The adjusted derivative contract amount is calculated by multiplying the adjusted notional amount by the supervisory delta adjustment, maturity factor, and applicable supervisory factor. 
3. The supervisory delta adjustment is 1 if the fair value of the derivative contract increases when the value of the primary risk factor increases and -1 if the fair value of the derivative contract decreases when the value of the primary risk factor increases. 
4. For an option contract, the supervisory delta adjustment is determined by the formulas in Table 1 to this section. 
5. A separate hedging set amount must be calculated for each basis derivative contract hedging set and each volatility derivative contract hedging set.
