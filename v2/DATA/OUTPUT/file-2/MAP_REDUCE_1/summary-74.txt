 1. The proposal defines a real price as a price, or other information, that is used to
determine the fair value of a banking organization's covered positions and is obtained from
either internal or external sources. 


2. To qualify as a real price, the price or other information must meet certain
requirements, including being observable, verifiable, and representative of the market
liquidity of the risk factor.


3. The proposal also provides a standard bucketing approach that banking organizations
can use to group real prices for the purpose of determining whether a risk factor passes the
risk factor eligibility test.


4. The proposal allows banking organizations to use their own bucketing approach,
provided that the internal risk management model uses the same buckets or segmentation of
risk factors to calculate profits and losses for purposes of the PLA test.


5. To determine whether the risk factors in a bucket pass the risk factor eligibility test, the
proposal requires a banking organization to allocate a real price to any risk bucket for which
the price is representative of the risk factors within the bucket and to count all real prices
mapped to a risk bucket.
