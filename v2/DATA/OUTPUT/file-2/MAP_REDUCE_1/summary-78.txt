 1. The proposal introduces a liquidity horizon-adjusted expected shortfall-based measure that captures potential losses over longer time horizons.


2. The measure is calculated at the entity-wide level for each risk class and across risk classes for all model-eligible trading desks.


3. The proposal also includes a stress period that is designed to capture potential losses in stressed market conditions.


4. The stress period is based on a twelve-month period of stress for which the banking organization's market risk covered positions on model-eligible trading desks would experience the largest cumulative loss.


5. The proposal requires banking organizations to review and update the stress period on at least a quarterly basis or whenever there are material changes in the risk factors of model-eligible trading desks.
