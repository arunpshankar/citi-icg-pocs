 1. The ES-based measure must be calculated for each business day at the trading desk level, at the aggregate level, and on the aggregate for each risk class for all model-eligible trading desks. 
2. The ES-based measure must be calculated using a one-tail, 97.5th percentile confidence level. 
3. A liquidity horizon-adjusted ES-based measure must be calculated from an ES-based measure at a base liquidity horizon of 10 days, with scaling applied to this base horizon result. 
4. The aggregate capital measure for modellable risk factors (IMCC) must be equal to the sum of the ES-based measure and the aggregate capital measure for non-modellable risk factors (SES). 
5. The non-default risk capital measure must be equal to the sum of the IMCC and the aggregate capital measure for non-modellable risk factors (SES).
