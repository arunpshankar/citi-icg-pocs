 1. The standardized CVA capital requirement is calculated as the sum of two components: the basic CVA approach capital requirement and the K-hedged CVA approach capital requirement. 
2. The basic CVA approach capital requirement is calculated as the product of the CVA risk exposure amount and the risk weight for the counterparty. 
3. The K-hedged CVA approach capital requirement is calculated as the product of the K-hedged CVA risk exposure amount and the risk weight for the counterparty. 
4. The CVA risk exposure amount is calculated as the sum of the EADs of all netting sets for the counterparty, multiplied by the discount factor for the netting set and the risk weight for the counterparty. 
5. The K-hedged CVA risk exposure amount is calculated as the difference between the P. Σ(SCVA, - SNH.) - IH
·Σ(SCVA - SNH₂)
