 1. The proposed definition of defaulted exposure is more conservative than banking organizations' existing policies and would result in more exposures being classified as defaulted. 
2. There are several operational challenges in identifying defaulted exposures, including obtaining information on obligors' credit obligations to other creditors and bankruptcy proceedings. 
3. The agencies request comment on the appropriateness of including a borrower's bankruptcy as a criterion for a defaulted exposure for retail exposures. 
4. The agencies request comment on alternatives to the proposed treatment of defaulted exposures, such as limiting the scope to obligations of the borrower with the banking organization. 
5. The proposal would assign a 20 percent risk weight to GSE exposures that are not equity exposures, securitization exposures or exposures to a subordinated debt instrument issued by a GSE. 
6. The proposal would define the scope of exposures to depository institutions, foreign banks, and credit unions in a manner that is consistent with the definitions and scope of exposures covered under the current capital rule. 
7. The proposal would provide three categories for bank exposures that are ranked from the highest to the lowest in terms of creditworthiness: Grade A, Grade B, and Grade C.
