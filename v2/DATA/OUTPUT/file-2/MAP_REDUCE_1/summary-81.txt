 1. The proposal introduces PLA test metrics, including the Spearman correlation and Kolmogorov-Smirnov metric, to assess the robustness of internal models. 


2.  Banking organizations must allocate model-eligible trading desks to PLA test zones based on the test results. 


3. The PLA add-on is calculated as the greater of zero and the capital benefit from the internal models approach, multiplied by a multiplication factor k. 


4. The value of k gradually increases from 0 to 0.5 as the number of model-eligible trading desks within the amber zone increases. 


5. The agencies seek comment on the PLA test metrics, the alignment of risk input data, the inclusion of non-modellable risk factors, and the calculation of the PLA add-on.
