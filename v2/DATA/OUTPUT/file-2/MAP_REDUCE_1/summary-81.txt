 1. The proposal introduces PLA test metrics to assess the robustness of a banking 
    organization's internal models. 
2. The PLA test metrics include the Spearman correlation and the Kolmogorov-Smirnov 
    metric. 
3. The proposal requires banking organizations to allocate each model-eligible trading 
    desk to a PLA test zone based on the test results. 
4. The PLA add-on is calculated as the greater of zero and the aggregate capital 
    benefit from the internal models approach, multiplied by a multiplication factor. 
5. The multiplication factor gradually increases from 0 to 0.5 as the number of model-
    eligible trading desks within the amber zone increases.
