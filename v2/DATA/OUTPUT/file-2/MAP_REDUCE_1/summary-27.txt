3. The proposal includes a new requirement that any applicable minimum payment threshold for the credit risk mitigant be consistent with standard market practice.


4. The proposal requires originating banking organizations to exclude transferred exposures from the calculation of their risk-weighted assets and maintain risk-based capital against any credit risk retained in connection with the resecuritization.


5. The proposal requires banking organizations to determine the capital requirements for most securitization exposures under the SEC-SA, which is substantively similar to the SSFA in the current capital rule except for certain changes.
