 1. The proposal introduces a standardized approach (SA-CVA) for calculating regulatory capital requirements for counterparty credit risk associated with derivative contracts. 


2. The SA-CVA approach is based on the exposure models used by banking organizations for calculating CVA for financial reporting purposes, adjusted to meet regulatory requirements. 


3. The proposal also includes a sensitivities-based method for calculating the SA-CVA capital requirement, which is similar to the proposed sensitivities-based method for market risk. 


4. The SA-CVA approach captures the effects of margining collateral and appropriately considers contractual features such as the nature of the margin agreement, frequency of margin calls, type of collateral, thresholds, independent amounts, initial margins, and minimum transfer amounts. 


5. The proposal establishes applicable risk factors, methods for calculating sensitivities, shock sizes, and aggregation formulas to ensure consistency in the application of risk-based capital requirements across banking organizations.
