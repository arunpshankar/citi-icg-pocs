 1. A banking organization may use the simple approach or the collateral haircut approach to recognize the risk-mitigating effects of financial collateral. 


2. The simple approach can be used for any exposure that is not a derivative contract or a netting set of derivative contracts, while the collateral haircut approach can be used for repo-style transactions, eligible margin loans, or a netting set of such transactions. 


3. Under the simple approach, the risk weight for the collateralized portion of the exposure may not be less than 20%, except for certain exceptions such as cash on deposit or exposures to sovereigns that qualify for a zero percent risk weight. 


4. Under the collateral haircut approach, the exposure amount for a netting set of eligible margin loans or repo-style transactions is calculated using a formula that includes the current fair value of the instruments, cash, or gold involved in the transaction, as well as haircuts appropriate for each instrument or gold. 


5. The collateral haircut approach also includes a formula to calculate the net exposure and gross exposure of the netting set.
