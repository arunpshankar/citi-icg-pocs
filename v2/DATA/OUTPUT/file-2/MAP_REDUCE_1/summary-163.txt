 1. The standardized total risk-weighted assets for securitization exposures are calculated by multiplying the corresponding risk weight for the exposure by 8%. 
2. Non-tranched hedges of correlation trading positions use the same risk weights as non-securitization debt or equity positions, excluding them from the standardized default risk capital requirement. 
3. The residual risk add-on is calculated for market risk covered positions that have an exotic exposure, are correlation trading positions with three or more underlying exposures, are subject to the curvature capital requirement or vega capital requirements, are options or positions with embedded options that do not have a maturity or strike price, or are determined by the [AGENCY] to require the add-on. 
4. The residual risk add-on is calculated by multiplying the sum of the gross effective notional amounts of market risk covered positions by the prescribed risk weight. 
5. To use the models-based measure for market risk, a [BANKING ORGANIZATION] must have at least one model-eligible trading desk and receive prior written approval from the [AGENCY].
