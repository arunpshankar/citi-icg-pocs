 1. The proposal revises the sign specification for the supervisory delta adjustment for CDO tranches to ensure the correct aggregation of CDO tranches with linear credit derivative contracts in PFE calculations.


2. The proposal extends the use of the shift parameter Î» to all asset classes to ensure that a banking organization can calculate the supervisory delta adjustment for option contracts when the underlying instrument or risk factor has a negative value.


3. The proposal clarifies that the option to decompose a non-linear index is not available under SA-CCR and that if electing to decompose a linear index, banking organizations must apply the weights used by the index when determining the exposure amounts for the underlying instrument.


4. The proposal does not require banking organizations to recognize any instrument as a credit risk mitigant, but credit derivatives that a banking organization cannot or chooses not to recognize as a credit risk mitigant would be subject to a separate counterparty credit risk capital requirement.


5. Questions raised for consideration include alternative approaches to calibrate the lambda parameter for non-interest-rate asset classes, potential values besides 1.1 for the multiplier in the proposed formula, and the rationale behind these alternatives.
