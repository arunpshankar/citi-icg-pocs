 1. The proposal revises the exclusion of initial margin from the trade exposure amount for banking organizations under the advanced approaches to align with the standardized approach.

4. The proposal does not make any changes to the existing capital rule's recognition of credit risk mitigants, such as guarantees, credit derivatives, and collateral. 
5. Questions 46 and 47 seek feedback on specific aspects of the proposal, including the calibration of the lambda parameter for non-interest-rate asset classes and alternative approaches to index decomposition.
