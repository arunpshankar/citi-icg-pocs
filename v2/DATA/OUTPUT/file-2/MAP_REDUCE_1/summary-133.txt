 1. The risk-weighted asset amount of an equity exposure to an investment fund is determined using one of three approaches: full look-through approach, alternative modified look-through approach, or 1250% risk weight. 
2. Under the full look-through approach, the risk-weighted asset amount is calculated as the adjusted carrying value multiplied by the risk weight, which is a function of the risk-weighted asset amounts of the investment fund's on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet exposures, as well as the derivative contracts held by the investment fund. 
3. Under the alternative modified look-through approach, the risk-weighted asset amount is calculated similarly to the full look-through approach, but with certain modifications, such as assigning the investment fund's total assets to different risk weight categories based on the investment limits in the investment fund's prospectus. 
4. If the [BANKING ORGANIZATION] does not have sufficient information to use either the full look-through approach or the alternative modified look-through approach, it must assign a risk-weighted asset amount equal to the adjusted carrying value of the equity exposure multiplied by a 1,250 percent risk weight.
