 1. The agencies should consider alternative minimum haircut floors that are based on a
percentage of the market value of the collateral, such as 10% or 20%. This would ensure
that the haircuts are more closely aligned with the actual risk of the collateral.
2. The advantages of setting the minimum haircuts at a higher level include:
a. It would reduce the risk of the banking organization being exposed to losses if the
collateral declines in value.
b. It would make it more difficult for banking organizations to use low-quality collateral to
meet the minimum haircut requirements.
3. The disadvantages of setting the minimum haircuts at a higher level include:
a. It would increase the cost of borrowing for banking organizations.
b. It would make it more difficult for banking organizations to find counterparties who are
willing to provide collateral.
4. The agencies should provide banking organizations with the flexibility to apply a single-
transaction haircut floor on a transaction-by-transaction basis for in-scope transactions within

even if the netting set did not meet the portfolio
