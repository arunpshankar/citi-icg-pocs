 1. The agencies propose correlation parameters for calculating capital requirements for market risk. 
2. For securitization positions, a 100% correlation parameter is proposed for positions with more than 80% overlap in notional terms, and a 40% correlation parameter otherwise. 
3. The agencies seek comment on alternative criteria for applying the 100% correlation parameter, such as allowing it if the securitization tranches can offset all or substantially all of the price risk of the position. 
4. The agencies also request comment on the appropriateness of a higher intra-bucket correlation parameter of 99.5% to 99.9% for energy-carbon trading, and on the use of a 35% correlation parameter for Uniform Mortgage Backed Securities. 
5. The standardized default risk capital requirement is intended to capture the incremental loss if the issuer of an equity or credit position were to immediately default.
