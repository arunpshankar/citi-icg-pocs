 **Section 1: Capital Requirements for Large Banking Organizations**

The banking regulators propose to revise the capital requirements for large banking organizations and those with significant trading activity. 

The proposed revisions aim to improve risk-based capital requirements, reduce complexity, enhance consistency, and facilitate effective supervisory and market assessments. 

The proposal includes replacing current requirements that use internal models for credit and operational risk with standardized approaches. 

It also replaces current market risk and credit valuation adjustment risk requirements with revised approaches. 

The proposed revisions generally align with recent changes to international capital standards issued by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision.

**Section 2: Standardized Approach for Credit Risk**

The proposal introduces a new standardized approach for credit risk applicable to large banking organizations. 

The proposal would replace the use of internal models to set regulatory capital requirements for credit risk. 

The proposal would retain many of the same definitions from the current capital rule, including sovereign, sovereign exposure, supranational entities, multilateral development bank, public sector entity, government-sponsored enterprise, other assets, and commitment. 

The proposal would apply the same risk-weight treatment provided in the current standardized approach to certain on-balance sheet exposures, including exposures to sovereigns, certain supranational entities and multilateral development banks, government sponsored entities (GSEs) in the form of senior debt and guaranteed exposures, Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) and Federal Agricultural Mortgage Corporation (Farmer Mac) equity exposures, public sector entities (PSES), and other assets. 

The proposal would also apply the same risk-weight treatment provided in the current standardized approach to the following real estate exposures: pre-sold construction loans, statutory multifamily mortgages, and high-volatility commercial real estate (HVCRE) exposures.

**Section 3: Risk-Based Approach for Retail Exposures**

The proposal introduces a risk-based capital framework for retail exposures, with three categories of retail exposures (Grade A, B, and C) based on the obligor's creditworthiness and publicly disclosed capital ratios. 

Grade A bank exposure is assigned a 40% risk weight, Grade B 75%, and Grade C 150%. 

The proposal also includes a risk weight floor for foreign bank exposures based on the risk weight applicable to a sovereign exposure for the jurisdiction where the foreign bank is incorporated. 

Subordinated debt instruments are defined and assigned a risk weight of 100%. 

The proposal addresses concerns around procyclicality by incorporating publicly disclosed capital levels in the determination of each of the three categories of bank exposures.

**Section 4: Standardized Approach for Operational Risk**

The proposal introduces a standardized approach for calculating risk-weighted assets for operational risk. 

The standardized approach is based on a bank's gross income and the business lines in which it operates. 

The proposal also includes a simplified approach for smaller banking organizations with less than $10 billion in total assets. 

The agencies seek comment on the impact of the proposed standardized approach, including its potential effects on the comparability of capital ratios across banking organizations and its potential to encourage or discourage certain types of business activities. 

The agencies also seek comment on the simplified approach for smaller banking organizations, including its potential to reduce the regulatory burden on these organizations.

**Section 5: Market Risk**

The proposal revises criteria for determining whether a banking organization is subject to market risk-based capital requirements. 

A banking organization with significant trading activity would be required to calculate market risk capital requirements. 

The proposed scope is designed to apply market risk capital requirements to all large banking organizations. 

The proposal would retain a trading activity threshold and increase the trading activity dollar threshold from $1 billion to $5 billion. 

The proposal would help promote consistency and comparability in market risk capital requirements across banking organizations.
