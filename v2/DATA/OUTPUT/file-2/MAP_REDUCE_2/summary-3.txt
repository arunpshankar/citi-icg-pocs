 SENSITIVITIES-BASED CAPITAL REQUIREMENT 

The sensitivities-based capital requirement is calculated for each risk class by aggregating the bucket-level risk positions for delta risk, vega risk, and curvature risk. 

DELTA CAPITAL REQUIREMENT 

The delta capital requirement is calculated for each risk class by aggregating the delta bucket-level risk positions across all of the buckets within the risk class. 

VEGA CAPITAL REQUIREMENT 

The vega capital requirement is calculated for each risk class by aggregating the vega bucket-level risk positions across all of the buckets within the risk class. 

CURVATURE CAPITAL REQUIREMENT 

The curvature capital requirement is calculated for each risk class by applying an upward shock and a downward shock to each risk factor and calculating the incremental loss in excess of that already captured by the delta capital requirement. 

SENSITIVITIES-BASED CAPITAL REQUIREMENT 

The sensitivities-based capital requirement equals the largest capital requirement produced under three correlation scenarios. 

MODEL PARAMETERS 

The Black-Scholes-Merton model with parameters calibrated to observed market prices; 

An alternative option pricing model that is approved by the [AGENCY]; or 

The delta sensitivities may be calculated using a non-model based approach that is approved by the [AGENCY]. 

CALCULATION FREQUENCY 

A [BANKING ORGANIZATION] must calculate the delta sensitivities, vega sensitivities, and curvature scenarios for each market risk covered position at least once per day. 

DOCUMENTATION 

A [BANKING ORGANIZATION] must document the methodologies, models, and parameters used to calculate the delta sensitivities, vega sensitivities, and curvature scenarios. 

DELTA SENSITIVITIES 

For each risk factor k, the delta sensitivity of an option is calculated as follows: 

k 
= 
∂ V 
∂ S k 
 
Delta sensitivities are assigned to different buckets based on the type of risk, with different risk weights applied to each bucket. 

For equity risk, delta sensitivities are further categorized into 13 buckets based on market capitalization and liquidity, with correlation parameters defined for each bucket. 

For commodity risk, delta sensitivities are assigned to 11 buckets based on the commodity type, with risk weights and correlation parameters specified for each bucket. 

For foreign exchange risk, buckets are established for each exchange rate, with delta sensitivities assigned to each bucket and risk weights applied accordingly. 

Cross-bucket correlation parameters are defined for aggregating delta bucket-level risk positions across buckets within each risk class. 

VEGA SENSITIVITIES 

Vega risk factors for interest rate risk are defined for each currency and consist of: 

Implied volatilities of inflation rate risk-sensitive options, 

Implied volatilities of cross-currency basis risk-sensitive options, and 

Implied volatilities of interest rate risk-sensitive options. 

Vega is the change in the value of an option resulting from a small change in volatility. 

For interest rate risk, a banking organization must map the implied volatility of the option to one or more tenors specified in the risk factors definitions. 

A banking organization must assign market risk covered positions that are options or positions with embedded options that do not have a maturity to the longest prescribed maturity tenor. 

Vega risk weights are specified for each risk class, and vega bucket-level risk positions are aggregated within a bucket using specified correlation parameters. 

For aggregating vega bucket-level risk positions across different buckets within a risk class, the same cross-bucket correlation parameters as specified for delta risk are used. 

CURVATURE RISK 

The curvature risk weights for foreign exchange risk and equity risk are based on the delta risk weights, while for other risk classes, the curvature risk weights are based on the highest prescribed delta risk weight for each bucket. 

CREDIT SPREAD RISK 

For credit spread risk, delta, vega, and curvature risk factors are defined for each credit spread curve. 

For non-securitization debt or equity positions, the standardized default risk capital requirement is the sum of the default risk capital requirement for each default risk category. 

A banking organization must calculate the gross default exposure for each non-securitization debt or equity position. 

A banking organization must assign LGD rates to non-securitization debt or equity positions based on the position's seniority and the credit quality of the reference exposure. 

A banking organization must calculate the standardized default risk capital requirement for securitization positions non-CTP by summing the bucket-level default risk capital requirements. 

The standardized default risk capital requirement for securitization positions non-CTP is calculated by assigning each position to a bucket and calculating the bucket-level default risk capital requirement. 

The standardized default risk capital requirement for correlation trading positions is calculated by assigning each index to a bucket and calculating the bucket-level default risk capital requirement. 

The gross default exposure for a correlation trading position is its market value, and the net default exposure is calculated by recognizing offsetting for otherwise identical positions. 

A [BANKING ORGANIZATION] may offset long and short gross default exposures of different tranches of the same index and series through replication and decomposition, if the residual component has the attachment and detachment point nested with the original tranche or the combination of tranches. 

For a non-securitization position that hedges a correlation trading position, a [BANKING ORGANIZATION] must assign such position and the related correlation trading position to the same bucket. 

The standardized total risk-weighted assets for securitization exposures are calculated by multiplying the corresponding risk weight for the exposure by 8%. 

Non-tranched hedges of correlation trading positions use the same risk weights as non-securitization debt or equity positions, excluding them from the standardized default risk capital requirement. 

The residual risk add-on is calculated for market risk covered positions that have an exotic exposure, are correlation trading positions with three or more underlying exposures, are subject to the curvature capital requirement, are options or positions with embedded options that do not have a maturity or strike price, or are determined by the [AGENCY] to require the add-on. 

The residual risk add-on is calculated as the sum of the gross effective notional amounts of market risk covered positions identified above, multiplied by the prescribed risk weight. 

MODEL-BASED MEASURE 

To use the models-based measure for market risk, a [BANKING ORGANIZATION] must have at least one model-eligible trading desk and receive prior written approval from the [AGENCY] for the trading desk structure. 

BACKTESTING AND PLA TESTING 

A model-eligible trading desk must conduct backtesting and PLA testing quarterly. 

Backtesting compares actual and hypothetical profit and loss with the VaR-based measure. 

PLA testing measures the potential impact of stressed market conditions on the trading desk. 

The trading desk must provide 250 business days of backtesting and PLA test results to the 
regulator. 

The regulator may rescind approval of a model-eligible trading desk if it no longer complies 
with the requirements. 

PLA TEST EXCEPTIONS 

A backtesting exception occurs when the actual daily profit or loss or hypothetical daily profit or loss at a given percentile exceeds the VaR-based measure for that day. 

A trading desk becomes model ineligible if it experiences more than 12 exceptions for actual profit and loss or 12 exceptions for hypothetical profit and loss at the 99th percentile or 30 exceptions for actual profit and loss or 30 exceptions for hypothetical profit and loss at the 97.5th percentile in the most recent 250 business day period. 

A trading desk that becomes model ineligible can regain eligibility by producing results in the PLA test green zone or PLA test amber zone and experiencing 12 or fewer exceptions for actual profit and loss and 12 exceptions for hypothetical profit and loss at the 99th percentile and 30 exceptions for actual profit and loss and 30 exceptions for hypothetical profit and loss at the 97.5th percentile in the most recent 250 business day period. 

At the trading desk level, the PLA test compares each of the trading desk's most recent 250 business days' hypothetical profit and loss with the 

The [AGENCY] may require a [BANKING ORGANIZATION] to identify the PLA test zone of a trading desk's PLA test results as a different PLA test zone. 

A trading desk that produces results in the PLA test amber or red zone is subject to the PLA add-on or becomes a model-ineligible trading desk, respectively. 

A model-ineligible trading desk can regain eligibility by meeting certain conditions. 

The PLA add-on is calculated as a function of the standardized approach capital requirement for market risk covered positions. 

LIQUIDITY HORIZON-ADJUSTED ES-BASED MEASURE 

A [BANKING ORGANIZATION] must identify an appropriate set of risk factors for calculating capital measures, including modellable and non-modellable risk factors. 

The ES-based measure must be calculated for each business day at the trading desk level, at the aggregate level, and on the aggregate for each risk class for all model-eligible trading desks. 

The ES-based measure must be calculated using a one-tail, 97.5th percentile confidence level. 

A liquidity horizon-adjusted ES-based measure must be calculated from an ES-based measure at a base liquidity horizon of 10 days, with scaling applied to this base horizon result. 

The aggregate capital measure for modellable risk factors (IMCC) must be equal to the sum of the ES-based measure and the aggregate capital measure for non-modellable risk factors (SES). 

The non-default risk capital measure must be equal to the sum of the IMCC and the aggregate capital measure for non-modellable risk factors (SES). 

LIQUIDITY HORIZON 

The liquidity horizon is the period over which a [BANKING ORGANIZATION] measures the change in the risk factors. 

The liquidity horizon is determined by the type of risk factor and the maturity of the market risk covered position. 

A [BANKING ORGANIZATION] must update its input data for internal models used to calculate the ES-based measure no less frequently than quarterly. 

Internal models used to calculate the ES-based measure must address non-linearities, as well as correlation and relevant basis risks. 

A [BANKING ORGANIZATION] must consistently assign a liquidity horizon to each of its risk factors and map each of its risk factors to one of the risk factor categories and corresponding liquidity horizons in Table 2 of this section. 

AGGREGATE CAPITAL MEASURE FOR MODELLABLE RISK FACTORS 

A [BANKING ORGANIZATION] must calculate an aggregate capital measure for modellable risk factors, IMCC, on each business day. 

The [BANKING ORGANIZATION] must also calculate a series of partial liquidity horizon-adjusted ES-based measures (with risk factors of all other risk factor classes held constant) for each risk factor class. 

The aggregate capital measure for modellable risk factors, IMCC, must be calculated as the weighted average of the constrained and unconstrained ES-based measures. 

A [BANKING ORGANIZATION] must calculate an aggregate capital measure for non-modellable risk factors, SES, using stressed expected shortfall methodologies. 

PUBLIC DISCLOSURES 

A [BANKING ORGANIZATION] must make timely public reports and disclosures each calendar quarter. 

The board of directors and senior management must ensure that appropriate verification of the reports and disclosures takes place and that effective internal controls and reporting and disclosure controls and procedures are maintained. 

If a [BANKING ORGANIZATION] reasonably believes that reporting or disclosure of specific commercial or financial information would materially prejudice its position by making public certain information that is either proprietary or confidential in nature, the [BANKING ORGANIZATION] is not required to publicly report or disclose these specific items. 

A [BANKING ORGANIZATION] must either provide all of the public reports and disclosures required by this section in one place on the [BANKING ORGANIZATION]'s public website or provide the reporting and disclosures in more than one public financial report or other public regulatory reports. 

A [BANKING ORGANIZATION] must disclose publicly the following information at least quarterly: 

The aggregate amount of o
