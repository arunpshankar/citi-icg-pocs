 SECTION 1: GENERAL REQUIREMENTS
- The proposal specifies capital treatment of internal CVA risk transfers.
- Banking organizations must maintain an internal written record of each internal derivative transaction.
- If the internal risk transfer is subject to curvature risk, default risk, or the residual risk add-on, the trading desk would have to execute an external transaction with a third party.
- The proposal sets forth general requirements for the recognition of CVA hedges that would be applicable to both internal transfers of CVA risk and external CVA hedges.
- The agencies propose to introduce the concept of a trading desk and apply the proposed internal models approach at the trading desk level.


SECTION 2: TRADING DESK STRUCTURE AND REQUIREMENTS
- Banking organizations should define their trading desk structure and identify trading desks that are used for internal risk transfers and notional trading desks.
- Notional trading desks must satisfy all general requirements for trading desks and those applicable for the models-based measure.
- The proposal would require a banking organization to have clearly defined trading and hedging strategies for their trading positions that are approved by senior management.
- The proposal would maintain certain operational requirements for active management of market risk covered positions, stress testing, control and oversight, and documentation.
- The proposal would strengthen a banking organization's prudent valuation practices by incorporating requirements that build on the agencies' overall regulatory framework for market risk management.


SECTION 3: OPERATIONAL REQUIREMENTS FOR THE MODELS-BASED MEASURE
- Banking organizations should have clear policies and procedures for actively managing and monitoring market risk covered positions, including daily monitoring of position limits and a broader set of risk metrics at the trading desk level.
- Stress testing and internal assessment of capital adequacy should be conducted at both the entity-wide and trading desk level, and results should be reviewed by senior management and reflected in policies and limits set by management and the board of directors.
- The independent risk control unit should have oversight responsibilities for the design and implementation of market risk management systems, and the internal audit function should assess the effectiveness of risk controls and the calculation of market risk capital requirements.
- Banking organizations should maintain conceptually sound systems and processes for identifying, measuring, monitoring, and managing market risk, and the internal audit function should assess the effectiveness of these systems and processes.
- The proposal enhances documentation requirements to reflect changes in the market risk capital framework, including the use of standardized and models-based measures for market risk and the introduction of a capital add-on requirement for re-designations.


SECTION 4: STANDARDIZED MEASURE FOR MARKET RISK
- The agencies propose a standardized approach to calculating market risk capital requirements, replacing the current internal models approach.
- The standardized measure for market risk consists of three main components: sensitivities-based method, standardized default risk capital requirement, and residual risk add-on.
- The proposal also includes three additional components that would apply in more limited instances to specific positions: fallback capital requirement, capital add-on for re-designations, and any additional capital requirement established by the primary Federal supervisor.
- The agencies view the proposed standardized measure for market risk as sufficiently risk sensitive to serve as a credible floor to the models-based measure for market risk.
- The primary Federal supervisor may require a banking organization to calculate capital requirements for specific positions or categories of positions under either subpart D or E instead of under subpart F of the capital rule, or under subpart F instead of under subpart D or E of the capital rule, or under both subpart F and subpart D or E, as applicable, to more appropriately reflect the risks of the positions.


SECTION 5: SENSITIVITIES-BASED METHOD
- The proposal introduces enhanced operational requirements for banking organizations that use the internal models approach under the models-based measure for market risk.
- These requirements include validation, documentation, model eligibility, ongoing eligibility, and changes to trading desk structure or internal models.
- The proposal establishes a framework for initial approval of internal models, including criteria for trading desks to satisfy in order to be considered model-eligible.
- Ongoing eligibility requirements include quarterly backtesting and PLA testing, and prior written approval from the primary Federal supervisor for any changes that could materially impact risk-weighted asset amounts or internal modelled capital calculations.
- The proposal aims to ensure that internal models accurately capture market risk and are appropriate for the trading desks they are applied to.


SECTION 6: STANDARDIZED DEFAULT RISK CAPITAL REQUIREMENT
- The proposal defines market risk covered positions and introduces a standardized measure for market risk.
- The standardized measure for market risk consists of three components: standardized approach capital requirement, fallback capital requirement, and capital add-on requirement for re-designations.
- The proposal requires banking organizations to calculate the standardized measure for market risk at least weekly.
- The sensitivities-based method under the standardized measure for market risk uses risk weights calibrated to a defined liquidity time horizon consistent with the expected shortfall measurement framework under stressed conditions.
- The proposal establishes a process to determine the sensitivities-based capital requirement for the portfolio, including assigning market risk covered positions to risk classes and establishing risk factors, calculating the sensitivity of a market risk covered position for each risk factor, describing the shock applied to each risk factor, and aggregating the weighted sensitivities.


SECTION 7: RISK FACTORS
- The sensitivities-based method for market risk proposed by the agencies captures the risks of positions subject to the market risk capital requirement by mapping them to specified risk factors and calculating capital requirements for delta, vega, and curvature.
- The proposed risk factors differ for each risk class to reflect the specific market risk variables relevant for each class.
- For risk classes that include specific tenors or maturities as risk factors, the proposal requires a banking organization to assign the risk factors to the proposed tenors through linear interpolation or a method that is most consistent with the pricing functions used by the internal risk management models.
- The sensitivities-based method is intended to promote consistency and comparability in regulatory capital requirements across banking organizations and to help ensure the appropriate capitalization of market risk covered positions.
- Comment is sought on the sensitivities-based method, including to what extent it appropriately captures the risks of positions subject to the market risk capital requirement, and what additional features, adjustments, or alternative methodology could be included to reflect these risks more appropriately.


SECTION 8: INTEREST RATE RISK
- The proposal defines the construction and use of interest rate curves for the currency in which interest rate-sensitive market risk covered positions are denominated.
- It also defines the delta, vega, and curvature risk factors for interest rate risk, credit spread risk, equity risk, and commodity risk.
- For interest rate risk, the proposal requires the use of separate curves for onshore and offshore currencies, as well as for different interest rate curve types.
- For credit spread risk, the proposal defines the delta, vega, and curvature risk factors for non-securitization positions, securitization positions that are not correlation trading positions, and correlation trading positions.
- For equity risk, the proposal defines the delta, vega, and curvature risk factors for each issuer, and for commodity risk, the proposal defines the delta, vega, and curvature risk factors for each commodity type.


SECTION 9: FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK
- The proposal defines delta risk factors for foreign exchange risk as the exchange rate between the currency in which the market risk covered position is denominated and the reporting currency of the banking organization.
- For positions referencing two currencies other than the reporting currency, the banking organization would calculate delta risk factors using exchange rates between each non-reporting currency and the reporting currency.
- The proposal allows a banking organization to calculate delta risk factors for foreign exchange risk relative to a base currency instead of the reporting currency, if approved by the primary Federal supervisor.
- The vega risk factors for foreign exchange risk are defined as the implied volatility of options that reference exchange rates between currency pairs along one dimension: the maturity of the option.
- The proposal would allow (but not require) a banking organization to treat a currency's onshore exchange rate and an offshore exchange rate as two distinct risk factors in the delta, vega and curvature calculations for foreign exchange risk.


SECTION 10: DELTA, VEGA, AND CURVATURE
- The delta sensitivity for positions with optionality is calculated using the sticky strike rule, sticky delta rule, or another assumption approved by the primary Federal supervisor.
- The vega sensitivity is calculated as the vega of an option multiplied by the volatility of the option.
- The vega capital requirement only applies to options or instruments with embedded optionality, including instruments with material prepayment risk.
- The curvature capital requirements are intended to capture the price risks inherent in instruments with optionality that are not already captured by delta.
- The proposal would require a banking organization to use the same risk buckets applied in the delta capital calculation to calculate curvature capital requirements.


SECTION 11: CALCULATION OF CURVATURE RISK-WEIGHTED SENSITIVITY
- The calculation of curvature risk-weighted sensitivity involves applying upward and downward shocks to the yield curve and measuring the change in value.
- The proposal requires a banking organization to apply the highest risk weight across risk buckets to each tenor point along the curve for conservatism.
- For the foreign exchange and equity risk classes, the shocks represent a relative shift of the spot prices equal to the delta risk weight.
- The proposal allows a banking organization to divide the net curvature risk positions by a scalar of 1.5 for positions that do not reference the reporting or base currency.
- The agencies seek comment on the appropriateness of calculating the curvature risk-weighted sensitivity for the commodity risk class using a parallel shift of all tenors.


SECTION 12: RISK WEIGHTS
- The proposal introduces a lower risk weight for interest rate risk factors for listed liquid currencies and other currencies specified by the primary Federal supervisor.
- The proposal defines delta credit spread risk buckets and corresponding risk weights for non-securitization positions, correlation trading positions, and securitization positions non-CTP based on investment grade, speculative grade, and sub-speculative grade.
- The proposal includes GSE debt and public sector entities in the sector for government-backed non-financials, education, and public administration.
- The proposal provides a separate risk bucket with higher risk weights for sub-speculative grade sovereigns and multilateral development banks.
- The proposal clarifies the treatment of personal loans and dealer floorplan loans within the delta credit spread risk buckets and provides definitions for prime and sub-prime residential mortgage-backed securities.


SECTION 13: DEFINITIONS
- The agencies propose using existing definitions for prime, subprime, and mid-prime residential mortgage-backed securities based on Regulation Z definitions.
- The agencies seek comment on the appropriateness of adding a sub-speculative grade category for non-securitizations and correlation trading positions.
- The agencies seek comment on the risk weight for covered bonds and alternative approaches to differentiate the credit quality of highly rated covered bonds without referring to credit ratings.
- The agencies seek comment on whether the proposed definitions for each sector bucket appropriately capture the characteristics to distinguish between the categories of residential mortgage-backed securities.
- The agencies seek comment on whether the proposed sector bucket definitions for residential mortgage-backed securities are sufficiently clear and what additional criteria should be considered to define "primarily."


SECTION 14: LIQUIDITY
- The proposal defines liquid market economies based on objective criteria, including GDP per capita, market capitalization, and trading volume.
- The proposed risk buckets for equity risk group trading positions into sectors based on economic sensitivities and delineate emerging market economies from liquid market economies.
- The proposed risk buckets for commodity risk are based on commodity classes and differentiated by underlying commodity types to reflect differences in volatility.
- The proposal aligns the delta risk factor buckets and corresponding risk weights for commodities with those in the Basel III reforms, with one exception.
- The proposal requires separate risk buckets for each exchange rate between the currency in which a market risk covered position is denominated and the reporting currency, with a 15 percent risk weight applied to each currency pair.


SECTION 15: CORRELATION PARAMETERS
- The agencies propose correlation parameters for calculating capital requirements for market risk.
- For securitization positions, a 100% correlation parameter is proposed for positions with more than 80% overlap in notional terms, and a 40% correlation parameter otherwise.
- The agencies seek comment on alternative criteria for applying the 100% correlation parameter, such as allowing it if the securitization tranches can offset all or substantially all of the price risk of the position.
- The agencies also request comment on the appropriateness of a higher intra-bucket correlation parameter of 99.5% to 99.9% for energy-carbon trading, and on the use of a 35% correlation parameter for Uniform Mortgage Backed Securities.
- The standardized default risk capital requirement is intended to capture the incremental loss if the issuer of an equity or credit position were to immediately default.


SECTION 16: CALCULATION OF DEFAULT EXPOSURE
- The proposal generally follows the Basel III calculation steps for non-securitization debt or equity positions.
- The gross default exposure is calculated as the product of notional amount and LGD, plus cumulative profits (losses).
- LGD rates are proposed for different categories of instruments, generally consistent with Basel III.
- Net default exposure allows full or partial offsetting of long and short positions with the same obligor and seniority.
- Scaling is applied to offsetting treatment for market risk covered positions with maturities of one year or less.


SECTION 17: NETTING
- The agencies propose allowing banks to net the gross default exposures of derivative contracts and the underlying positions that are deliverable to satisfy the derivative contract.
- The agencies seek comment on the appropriateness of the proposed treatment of GSE exposures and alternative methods to measure more appropriately the default risk associated with such positions.
- The agencies propose not allowing banks to recognize any offsetting benefit for market risk covered positions where the obligor is not identified. They seek comment on alternative methods to measure more appropriately the default risk associated with such positions.
- The agencies propose risk buckets and corresponding risk weights for non-securitization debt or equity positions and securitization positions non-CTP. They seek comment on the appropriateness of the proposed risk weights and granularity and alternative approaches for assigning risk weights.
- The agencies propose netting and decomposition criteria for calculating the net default exposure for securitization positions non-CTP. They seek comment on alternative non-model-based methodologies that would conservatively recognize some hedging benefits but still capture the basis risk between non-identical positions.


SECTION 18: CORRELATION TRADING POSITIONS
- The proposal introduces a standardized approach to calculate the default risk capital requirement for correlation trading positions.
- The gross default exposure is measured as the position's market value, and the net default exposure is calculated by offsetting long and short exposures in specific cases.
- Risk buckets are defined by index, and a bespoke correlation trading position is assigned to its own unique bucket unless it is substantially similar to an index instrument.
- The risk weights corresponding to the proposed risk buckets are based on the treatment under either subpart D or subpart E of the capital rule.
- A residual risk add-on capital requirement is proposed to capture exotic risks and other residual risks not fully reflected in the sensitivities-based capital requirement or the standardized default risk capital requirement.


SECTION 19: RESIDUAL RISK ADD-ON
- The proposal requires banking organizations to calculate a residual risk add-on for market risk covered positions with exotic exposures and certain other residual risks.
- The residual risk add-on capital requirement would equal the sum of such capital requirements across subject market risk covered positions.
- Positions subject to the residual risk add-on include those with exotic exposures, certain correlation trading positions, options or positions with embedded optionality, and other positions as determined by the primary Federal supervisor.
- Excluded positions include those that are listed on an exchange, eligible to be cleared by a CCP or QCCP, certain options, and certain offsetting positions.
- The agencies seek comment on all aspects of the proposed residual risk add-on, including alternative methods to identify exotic exposures and other residual risks, additional instruments and offsetting positions that should be excluded, and quantitative measures to identify or distinguish residual risks.


SECTION 20: INDEX INSTRUMENTS AND MULTI-UNDERLYING OPTIONS
- The proposal generally requires a look-through approach for index instruments and multi-underlying options, but it allows for a single sensitivity for listed and well-diversified credit or equity indices.
- For multi-underlying options (including index options), the proposal permits, but does not require, a banking organization to apply the look-through approach required for delta and calculate the vega capital requirements based on the implied volatility of options on the underlying constituents.
- The proposal requires a banking organization to apply the look-through approach when calculating the standardized default risk capital requirement for multi-underlying options that are non-securitization debt or equity positions.
- The proposal would provide greater hedging recognition by allowing such instruments to net with single-name positions issued by the same company.
- The agencies seek comment on the proposed 75 percent threshold for assigning a credit or equity index to the corresponding sector or the investment grade indices bucket, as well as on all aspects of the proposed treatment of index instruments and multi-underlying options under the standardized measure for market risk.


SECTION 21: INTERNAL MODELS APPROACH
- The agencies seek comment on the internal models approach for market risk.
- The proposal would require a banking organization to identify an appropriate set of risk factors that is sufficiently representative of the risks inherent in all of the market risk covered positions held by model-eligible trading desks.
- For the identified risk factors, the proposal would require banking organization to conduct the risk factor eligibility test to determine which risk factors are modellable, and thus subject to the IMCC, and which are non-modellable, and thus subject to the SES capital requirements.
- The agencies recognize that a banking organization may need to obtain pricing information from third parties to demonstrate the market liquidity of the underlying risk factors, and this may pose unique challenges for validation and other model risk management activities.
- In certain cases, obtaining information on the prices of individual transactions from third parties may raise legal concerns for the banking organization, the third-party provider, or both.


SECTION 22: REAL PRICES
- The proposal defines a real price as a price, or other information, that is used to determine the fair value of a banking organization's covered positions and is obtained from either internal or external sources.
- To qualify as a real price, the price or other information must meet certain requirements, including being observable, verifiable, and representative of the market liquidity of the risk factor.
- The proposal also provides a standard bucketing approach that banking organizations can use to group real prices for the purpose of determining whether a risk factor passes the risk factor eligibility test.
- The proposal allows banking organizations to use their own bucketing approach, provided that the internal risk management model uses the same buckets or segmentation of risk factors to calculate profits and losses for purposes of the PLA test.
- To determine whether the risk factors in a bucket pass the risk factor eligibility test, the proposal requires a banking organization to allocate a real price to any risk bucket for which the price is representative of the risk factors within the bucket and to count all real prices mapped to a risk bucket.


SECTION 23: DATA QUALITY
- The proposal introduces data quality requirements for modellable risk factors.
- Risk factors passing the eligibility test but failing to meet any of the seven data quality requirements would be non-modellable.
- Data should reflect market prices or be reasonably representative of real
