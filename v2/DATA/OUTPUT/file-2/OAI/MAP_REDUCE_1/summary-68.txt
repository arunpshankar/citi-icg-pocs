1. The proposal requires banking organizations to calculate the total standardized default risk capital requirement as the sum of each default risk category level capital requirements, without recognizing any diversification benefits across different types of default risk categories. 
2. For non-securitization debt or equity positions, the gross default exposure is calculated by multiplying the notional amount of the instrument and the prescribed loss given default (LGD) rate to determine the total potential loss of principal at default. 
3. The proposal specifies LGD rates for different types of instruments, including 100 percent for equity and non-senior debt instruments and defaulted positions, 75 percent for senior debt instruments, and zero percent for instruments whose value is not linked to the recovery rate of the issuer. 
4. The proposal allows for either full or partial offsetting of the gross default exposures for long and short positions if both reference the same obligor and the short positions have the same or lower seniority as the long positions. 
5. For derivative transactions, the proposal requires a banking organization to use the maturity of the derivative contract, rather than that of the underlying, to determine the applicable scaling factor.
