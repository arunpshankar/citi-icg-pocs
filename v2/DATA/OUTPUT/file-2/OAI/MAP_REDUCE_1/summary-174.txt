1. A banking organization must calculate the CVA vega capital requirement, which is the sum of the risk class-level CVA vega capital requirements for five risk classes: interest rate risk, foreign exchange risk, reference credit spread risk, equity risk, and commodity risk. 
2. The organization must also calculate the net weighted vega sensitivity for each risk factor, which involves calculating the CVA vega sensitivity of aggregate regulatory CVA and the CVA vega sensitivity of the aggregate market value of standardized CVA hedges to the risk factor. 
3. The organization must calculate the bucket-level CVA vega capital requirement by aggregating the net weighted vega sensitivities for each risk factor in a bucket, using the buckets and correlation parameters applicable to each risk class. 
4. The organization must calculate the risk class-level CVA vega capital requirement by aggregating the bucket-level CVA vega capital requirements for each bucket in the risk class using the correlation parameters applicable to each risk class. 
5. The organization must calculate aggregate regulatory CVA as the sum of regulatory CVA for each counterparty, which is calculated as the expected loss resulting from default of the counterparty and assuming non-default of the banking organization.
