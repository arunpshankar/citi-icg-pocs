1. The proposal requires banking organizations to calculate market risk capital requirements for model-eligible trading desks incorporating securitization positions in their PLA test metrics, using a conservative capital treatment under the standardized approach or the fallback capital requirement.
2. For the PLA test, the banking organization must compare the risk-theoretical profit and loss and the hypothetical profit and loss for each model-eligible trading desk over the most recent 250 business days, using two test metrics: the Spearman correlation and the Kolmogorov-Smirnov metric.
3. The Spearman correlation metric assesses the correlation between the daily risk-theoretical profit and loss and the hypothetical profit and loss for a model-eligible trading desk, while the Kolmogorov-Smirnov metric assesses the similarity of the distribution of the daily portfolio values generated by the internal risk management models and the front office models.
4. Based on the PLA test results, a banking organization must allocate each model-eligible trading desk to a PLA test zone, and the primary Federal supervisor can require a banking organization to assign a different PLA test zone to a model-eligible trading desk than that based on PLA test metrics.
5. The proposal allows banking organizations to consider model-eligible trading desks in the green zone or amber
