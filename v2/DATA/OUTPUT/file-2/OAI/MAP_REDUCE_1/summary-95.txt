The SA-CVA introduces an optional approach that includes additional index risk factors for qualified indices, reducing the complexity of individual calculations. The proposal defines delta and vega risk factors for five market risk classes in a less granular way than the sensitivity-based method for market risk. For interest rate risk, individual buckets are defined by currency, consisting of interest rate risk factors and inflation rate risk factors. For foreign exchange risk, delta and vega risk buckets are defined as individual foreign currencies. The proposal also defines risk buckets for the delta and vega risk factors by sector and credit quality, consistent with the definitions of risk buckets for non-securitization credit spread risk.
