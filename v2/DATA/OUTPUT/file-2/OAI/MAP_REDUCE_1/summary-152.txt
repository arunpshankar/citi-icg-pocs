1. The dynamics of implied volatility are such that when the price of the underlying changes, the implied volatility of an option or a market risk covered position with an embedded option will remain unchanged for any given moneyness (sticky delta rule) or for any given strike price (sticky strike rule). 
2. The curvature scenarios and sensitivities to the delta risk factors for credit spread risk for securitization positions non-CTP and correlation trading positions must be calculated with respect to the spread of the tranche and the underlying names of the securitization position respectively. 
3. A banking organization must calculate the delta sensitivities, vega sensitivities, and curvature scenarios for each risk class in the reporting currency of the banking organization, except for the foreign exchange risk class where, with prior written approval of the agency, the banking organization may calculate sensitivities and curvature scenarios relative to a base currency instead of the reporting currency. 
4. A banking organization must calculate all sensitivities ignoring the impact of CVA on fair values. 
5. The delta sensitivity for various risks such as interest rate risk, credit spread risk, equity risk, commodity risk, and foreign exchange risk is calculated by changing the relevant factor by a certain amount and dividing the resulting change in
