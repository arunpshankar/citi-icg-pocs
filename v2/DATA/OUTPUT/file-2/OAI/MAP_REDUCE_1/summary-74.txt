1. The proposed definition for real price qualification would allow banking organizations to demonstrate the market liquidity of a risk factor and ensure sufficient documentation for validity assessment by the organization and the primary Federal supervisor. The agencies are considering additional information to better demonstrate market liquidity for risk factors and conditions to ensure the validity of such information.
2. To determine if a risk factor passes the eligibility test, banking organizations would map real prices to each risk factor and define risk buckets at the risk factor level. They could choose either their own bucketing approach or the standard one, depending on their trading strategies.
3. The proposal provides a standard bucketing approach based on the type of risk factor, the maturity of the instruments used for real prices, and the probability that an option has value at maturity. The proposed buckets aim to balance the granularity of risk factors and the compliance burden of tracking and mapping real prices to more granular buckets.
4. Banking organizations can define more granular risk factor buckets using their own approach, provided their internal risk management model uses the same buckets to calculate profits and losses. However, this would place an additional operational burden on the organization to demonstrate the appropriateness of using a more granular bucketing structure.
5. For a risk factor to pass the eligibility test, a banking
