1. A banking organization must apply the look-through approach for any market risk covered position that is an index instrument or a multi-underlying option, allowing netting with single-name positions and consistent application across all market risk covered positions referencing the same index.
2. For listed and well-diversified indices, a banking organization may choose not to apply the look-through approach, instead calculating a single sensitivity to the index and assigning it to the relevant sector or index bucket, with specific rules for sector-specific, equity, and credit indices.
3. The vega capital requirement for a multi-underlying option can be calculated based on the implied volatility of the option or the implied volatility of options on the underlying constituents, with the requirement for indices calculated based on the same sector specific bucket or index bucket used for the delta and curvature capital requirements.
4. The look-through approach can be applied for multi-underlying options that are non-securitization debt or equity positions when calculating the standardized default risk capital requirement.
5. For equity positions in an investment fund, a banking organization must apply the look-through approach for calculating the market risk capital requirement, treating the underlying positions of the fund as if they were held directly by the organization, with alternative methods available if the look-through approach cannot be used
