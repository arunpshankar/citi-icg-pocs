Securitization exposures, which involve tranching of credit risk, can include asset-backed securities, mortgage-backed securities, loans, and other financial instruments. However, mortgage-backed pass-through securities that do not involve tranching of credit risk do not qualify as securitization exposures. Over-the-counter (OTC) derivative contracts, which are bilateral agreements to make or receive payments or to buy or sell an asset in the future, carry credit risk. The credit valuation adjustment (CVA) risk of OTC derivative contracts depends on counterparty credit spreads and credit exposure. The proposal would require large banking organizations to calculate a risk-weighted asset amount for the CVA risk arising from their portfolio of OTC derivative transactions.
