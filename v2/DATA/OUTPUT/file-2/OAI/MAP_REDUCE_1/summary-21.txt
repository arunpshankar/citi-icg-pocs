Banks can reduce credit risk and associated capital requirements by using collateral and other credit risk mitigants. These mitigants must be of high quality to effectively reduce credit risk. The proposal would eliminate the use of models for credit risk under the current capital rule and replace them with standardized approaches. For collateralized transactions, the issuer of any financial collateral must have an outstanding publicly traded security or be controlled by a company with such a security. The proposal would also introduce minimum haircut floors for certain transactions with unregulated financial institutions.
