The proposal allows for different periods to be used for internal data for the risk factor eligibility test and the expected shortfall model, provided they match the period used for external data. For new issuances, the observation period for the risk factor eligibility test begins on the issuance date, with the number of real prices required to pass the test pro-rated until 12 months after issuance. The proposal allows banking organizations to use quotes of discontinued reference rates to pass the risk factor eligibility test until the new reference rate's liquidity improves. Risk factors within a bucket that pass the risk factor eligibility test and meet data quality requirements are deemed modellable, while those that fail are classified as non-modellable. Once a risk factor passes the eligibility test, the banking organization must choose the most appropriate data for calculating the IMCC for modellable risk factors.
