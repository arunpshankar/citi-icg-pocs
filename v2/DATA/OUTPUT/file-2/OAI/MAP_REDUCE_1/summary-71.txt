The proposal requires banking organizations to calculate a residual risk add-on for market risk covered positions with exotic exposure and other residual risks. The capital requirement for positions with exotic exposure is 1% of the gross effective notional amount, while for other residual risks it is 0.1%. The proposal also allows the primary Federal supervisor to subject other market risk covered positions to the residual risk add-on if necessary. Certain positions can be excluded from the residual risk add-on calculation, including those listed on an exchange, eligible to be cleared by a CCP or QCCP, or simple options. The proposal also prescribes the treatment of hybrid instruments, index instruments, and multi-underlying options under the standardized approach.
