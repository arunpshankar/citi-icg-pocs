To calculate the standardized default risk capital requirement for non-CTP securitization positions, a banking organization must assign each position to a specific bucket, such as corporate positions or asset class buckets. The asset class buckets are defined by two dimensions: asset class and region. The banking organization must rely on market convention for classifying these positions and each position must be assigned to exactly one bucket. The bucket-level default risk capital requirement is then calculated for each bucket. The standardized default risk capital requirement for non-CTP securitization positions equals the sum of the bucket-level default risk capital requirements.
