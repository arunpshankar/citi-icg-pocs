The agencies are proposing amendments to their market risk information collections to reflect proposed recordkeeping, disclosure, and reporting requirements associated with market risk capital requirements. Banking organizations subject to these requirements would need to provide public regulatory reports and receive prior written approval from their primary Federal supervisor for calculating market risk capital requirements using internal models. The proposal also includes recordkeeping requirements for banking organizations subject to the credit valuation adjustment. The estimated annual burden hours for these changes is 22,370. The Board is also proposing amendments to the FR Y-9C report form and instructions to align with the proposal, which is estimated to increase the annual burden by 49 hours.
