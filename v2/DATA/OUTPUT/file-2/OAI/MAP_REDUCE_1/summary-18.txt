The proposal defines a project finance exposure as a corporate exposure where the banking organization relies on the revenues generated by a single project for repayment and security. The primary determinant of credit risk is the variability of the project's cash flows. The proposal assigns a 130% risk weight during the pre-operational phase and a 100% risk weight during the operational phase. Off-balance sheet exposures, such as commitments, contingent items, and guarantees, are also considered, with credit conversion factors ranging from 10% to 100% applied to calculate the exposure amount. The proposal maintains the existing definition of commitment under the current capital rule.
