1. If a desk fails to receive approval for the internal models approach or fails to meet operational requirements, it must use the standardized approach to calculate its market risk capital requirements. This ensures that risk-based capital requirements capture the market risks to which a bank is exposed.
2. The proposed standardized measure for market risk relies on a banking organization's models to produce risk factor sensitivities, ensuring market risk capital requirements capture a banking organization's actual market risk exposure.
3. The proposed models-based measure for market risk would limit the use of the internal models approach to only those trading desks that can appropriately capture the risks of market risk covered positions in internal models.
4. The models-based measure for market risk would cap the sum of the internal models approach capital requirements, the PLA add-on, and the standardized approach capital requirements at the capital required for all trading desks under the standardized approach.
5. The proposed models-based measure for market risk would provide important improvements to the risk sensitivity and calibration of risk-weighted assets for market risk, replacing the VaR-based measure with an expected shortfall measure to capture tail risk and varying liquidity horizons based on underlying risk factors.
