1. The document discusses the calculation of KG, the weighted average total capital requirement, for financial exposures. For interest rate and exchange rate derivative contracts, the positive current exposure times the risk weight of the counterparty multiplied by 0.08 must be included in the numerator of KG but excluded from the denominator.
2. If a banking organization transfers credit risk via a synthetic securitization to a securitization SPE, the total capital requirement of any collateral held by the SPE must be included in the numerator of KG, with the denominator calculated without recognition of the collateral.
3. The document also covers the recognition of credit risk mitigants for securitization exposures. Banking organizations that have obtained a credit risk mitigant to hedge their exposure to a synthetic or traditional securitization may recognize the mitigant under certain conditions.
4. The document further discusses risk-weighted assets for equity exposures. Banking organizations must use specific approaches to calculate risk-weighted asset amounts for equity exposures that are not in investment funds, and for other equity exposures.
5. The document also provides guidelines for the calculation of risk-weighted asset amounts for individual equity exposures, assigning different risk weights to different types of exposures, such as zero percent for exposures to sovereign entities, 20 percent for
