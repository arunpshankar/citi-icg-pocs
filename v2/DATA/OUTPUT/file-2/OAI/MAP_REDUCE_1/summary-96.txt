1. The SA-CVA method assigns one delta and one vega risk factor per risk bucket for foreign exchange, reference credit spread, equity, and commodity risk classes, eliminating the need for intra-bucket correlations. The risk weights for these classes generally match those used in the sensitivities-based method for market risk.
2. For the interest rate risk class, the SA-CVA method has two groups of risk buckets/currencies: specified currencies (USD, EUR, GBP, AUD, CAD, SEK, and JPY) and other currencies. These groups differ in the value of risk weights and the level of granularity for delta risk factors.
3. The SA-CVA method specifies delta risk factors for specified currencies as the absolute changes of the inflation rate and risk-free yields for five tenors: 1 year, 2 years, 5 years, 10 years, and 30 years. Risk weights for these factors are set approximately equal to the general risk weights for the inflation rate and corresponding tenors of risk-free yields in the sensitivities-based method for market risk.
4. For counterparty credit spread risk class, the risk weights under the SA-CVA method match those for reference credit spread delta risk factors. The proposal modifies risk bucket definitions for non-secur
