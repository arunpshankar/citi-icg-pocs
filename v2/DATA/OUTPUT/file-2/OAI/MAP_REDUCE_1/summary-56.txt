1. A banking organization's primary Federal supervisor can determine if a model-eligible trading desk no longer complies with the requirements for use of the models-based measure for market risk. If non-compliance is found, the supervisor can rescind the desk's model approval and require the desk to calculate market risk capital requirements under the standardized approach, or subject the desk to a PLA add-on capital requirement until full approval is restored.
2. The proposal allows the primary Federal supervisor to subject the trading desk to the PLA add-on if the desk continues to satisfy all of the proposed backtesting, PLA testing, and operational requirements for use of the models-based measure for market risk. This ensures that the market risk capital requirements for the trading desk appropriately reflect the materiality of the shortcomings of the expected shortfall model.
3. If a banking organization's stressed expected shortfall methodology for capturing non-modellable risk factors no longer complies with the operational requirements, the primary Federal supervisor can rescind its approval and require the affected trading desk(s) to calculate market risk capital requirements under the standardized approach.
4. The proposal introduces a standardized methodology for calculating market risk capital requirements and a new methodology for the internal models approach. A banking organization with one or more model-eligible trading desks would be required to
