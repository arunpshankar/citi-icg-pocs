The Advanced Measurement Approaches (AMA) for banking organizations, based on internal models, has led to significant challenges due to its uncertainty, volatility, and lack of transparency. To address these issues, a proposal has been made to replace the AMA with a standardized approach for operational risk. This new approach would calculate operational risk capital requirements based on a banking organization's business indicator component and internal loss multiplier. The business indicator would serve as a measure of the organization's business volume and would be calculated based on three components: interest, lease, and dividend; services; and financial. The internal loss multiplier would be based on the ratio of the organization's historical operational losses to its business indicator component, increasing the operational risk capital requirement as historical operational losses increase.
