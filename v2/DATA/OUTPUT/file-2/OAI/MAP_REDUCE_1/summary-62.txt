1. When calculating delta sensitivity for positions with optionality, a banking organization can use the sticky strike rule, the sticky delta rule, or another assumption approved by its primary Federal supervisor. These methods measure the sensitivity of a risk factor within any risk class.
2. Vega sensitivity for market risk covered positions with optionality is calculated by multiplying the vega of an option by the volatility of the option. The vega capital requirement applies to options or instruments with embedded optionality, including those with material prepayment risk.
3. Callable and puttable bonds priced based on yield to maturity are not subject to the vega capital requirement. Banking organizations may exclude these from the vega capital requirement as the delta capital requirement is considered sufficiently conservative.
4. To calculate vega sensitivity, banking organizations must assign options to buckets based on their maturity. Instruments with optionality that do not have a stated maturity or have an undefined maturity are assigned to the longest prescribed maturity tenor for vega.
5. The proposed curvature capital requirements aim to capture price risks in instruments with optionality not captured by delta. Only options or positions with embedded optionality that present material price risks not captured by delta would be subject to the curvature capital requirement.
