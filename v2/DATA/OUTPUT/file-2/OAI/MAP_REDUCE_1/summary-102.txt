The eSLR rule, established in 2014, applies to U.S. top-tier bank holding companies with consolidated assets over $700 billion or more than $10 trillion in assets under custody. In 2015, a methodology for identifying a bank holding company as a U.S. GSIB and applying a risk-based capital surcharge was established. The OCC's current eSLR rule applies to national banks and Federal savings associations that are subsidiaries of U.S. top-tier bank holding companies with more than $700 billion in total consolidated assets or more than $10 trillion total in assets under custody. The OCC is proposing to revise its eSLR rule to ensure that the eSLR standard will apply to only those national banks and Federal savings associations that are subsidiaries of holding companies identified as U.S. GSIBs under the GSIB surcharge rule. Additionally, the OCC is proposing to correct an error in the definition of financial collateral.
