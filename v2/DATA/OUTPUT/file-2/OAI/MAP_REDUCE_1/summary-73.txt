1. During periods of stress, correlations increase compared to normal market conditions. The conservative treatment of non-modellable risk factors under the SES calculation encourages banking organizations to improve the quality of model inputs.
2. The internal models approach includes a standardized default risk capital requirement. To calculate the overall capital required, a banking organization would add the standardized default risk capital requirement to the greater of the sum of the capital requirements for modellable and non-modellable risk factors as of the most recent reporting date, or the sum of the average capital requirements for non-modellable risk factors over the prior 60 business days.
3. The capital multiplier (mc) is expected to reflect the capital requirements for modellable and non-modellable risk factors based on the prior 60 business day average, reducing quarterly variation. The proposal would require a banking organization to consider the capital requirements as of the most recent reporting date to capture situations where the banking organization has significantly increased its risk taking.
4. A banking organization intending to use the internal models approach would be required to identify an appropriate set of risk factors that is representative of the risks inherent in all of the market risk covered positions held by model-eligible trading desks. The proposal would require a banking organization's expected shortfall models to include
