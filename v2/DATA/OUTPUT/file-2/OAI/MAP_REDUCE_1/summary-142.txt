1. A banking organization's equity position in an investment fund must meet one of two criteria: access to the fund's prospectus, partnership agreement, or similar contract that defines the fund's permissible investments and investment limits, and either the ability to calculate a market risk capital requirement or obtain daily price quotes for the fund. 
2. The banking organization may hold positions with the intent to securitize, direct real estate holdings, derivative instruments, debt securities, and significant investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions. 
3. A net short risk position is calculated by comparing the notional amounts of a banking organization's long and short positions for a given exposure, provided that the short position exceeds the long position. 
4. Non-securitization position refers to a market risk covered position that is not a securitization position or a correlation trading position and reacts primarily to changes in interest rates or credit spreads. 
5. A pricing model can be a valuation model used for financial reporting or for internal risk management, and profit and loss attribution is a method for assessing the robustness of a banking organization's internal models used to calculate the ES-based measure.
