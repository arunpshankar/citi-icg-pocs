The proposal aims to increase the credit risk-sensitivity of capital requirements for retail exposures by assigning risk weights that vary based on product type and portfolio diversification. The new definition of retail exposure includes exposure to individuals or small to medium-sized entities (SMEs), benefiting smaller companies with characteristics more akin to individuals than larger corporations. The proposal differentiates risk-weight treatment for retail exposures based on whether they qualify as regulatory retail exposures, transactor exposures, or other retail exposures. Regulatory retail exposures are limited on an aggregate and granular basis, with a risk weight of 55% for transactor exposures and 85% for non-transactor exposures. Any retail exposure not qualifying as regulatory retail or transactor exposure warrants a risk weight of 110%.
