The proposal outlines term-based haircuts for investment grade senior securitization exposures with a risk weight of less than 100 percent. Other securitization exposures would receive a 30 percent market price volatility haircut. The proposal also requires banking organizations to apply market price volatility haircuts of 20 percent for main index equities and gold, and 30 percent for other publicly traded equities and exposure types. For collateral in the form of mutual fund shares, the proposal would require banking organizations to apply the highest haircut applicable to any security in which the fund can invest. The proposal also includes a framework for minimum haircuts on non-centrally cleared securities financing transactions to reflect the risk exposure of banking organizations to non-bank financial entities.
