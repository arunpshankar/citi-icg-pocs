The proposal expands the types of positions that would be covered by market risk, including certain equity positions in an investment fund, net short risk positions, certain publicly traded equity positions, embedded derivatives on instruments issued by the banking organization, and certain positions associated with internal risk transfer. Equity positions in an investment fund would be included as market risk covered positions if the banking organization has access to the fund's prospectus and meets one of two conditions. The proposal introduces a new term, net short risk positions, to describe over-hedges of credit and equity exposures that are not market risk covered positions. All publicly traded equity positions would be included as market risk covered positions, regardless of whether they are trading assets or trading liabilities. Lastly, the proposal would include the embedded derivative in the definition of market risk covered position if a banking organization issues hybrid instruments that contain an embedded derivative related to credit or equity risk.
