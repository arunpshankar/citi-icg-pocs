The operational risk capital requirement for a banking organization is calculated based on an average of ten years of data on total net operational losses. An "operational loss" is defined as all losses resulting from an operational loss event, excluding insurance or tax effects, opportunity costs, forgone revenue, and costs related to risk management. Operational loss events are classified into seven types, including internal and external fraud, employment practices and workplace safety, clients, products, and business practices, damage to physical assets, business disruption and system failures, and execution, delivery, and process management. The proposal includes a $20,000 net loss threshold for inclusion of an operational loss in the calculation. The proposal also requires banking organizations to group losses with a common underlying trigger into the same operational loss event.
