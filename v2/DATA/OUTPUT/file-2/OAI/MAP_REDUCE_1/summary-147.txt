1. The capital add-on for re-designation is calculated at the time of re-designation and can decrease as the exposure or position matures or expires. However, with prior approval, no capital add-on is required if the re-designation is due to uncontrollable circumstances.
2. Re-designation is irrevocable unless approved by the agency. Capital add-on for ineligible positions on model-eligible trading desks must be calculated for certain positions.
3. Banking organizations must generate backtesting data for transactions on model-eligible trading desks, comparing each business day's actual and hypothetical profit and loss with the corresponding VaR-based measures.
4. Exceptions occur when actual or hypothetical losses exceed the VaR-based measure, or when these measures are unavailable or impossible to compute. Exceptions may be disregarded with agency approval under certain conditions.
5. Banking organizations must conduct aggregate trading portfolio backtesting quarterly, counting the number of exceptions over the most recent 250 business days. The multiplication factor for the non-default risk capital requirement is determined by the overall number of exceptions.
