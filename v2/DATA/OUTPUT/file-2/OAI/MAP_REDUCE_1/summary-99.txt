The proposed expanded risk-based framework would increase overall risk-weighted assets, making it the binding risk-based approach for most large banking organizations. This would make capital requirements more sensitive to specific risks of large banking organizations. The proposal would not change the minimum required capital ratios, but the amount of required capital would change due to changes in the calculation of risk-weighted assets. This would increase the binding common equity tier 1 capital requirement of large holding companies by around 16 percent. While most large banking organizations already meet the proposed requirements, the proposal would likely result in an increase in equity capital funding maintained by these organizations.
