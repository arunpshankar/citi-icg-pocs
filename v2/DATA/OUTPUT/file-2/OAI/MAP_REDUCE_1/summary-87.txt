The risk of a Central Counterparty (CCP) participant defaulting is covered by the clearing members of the CCP, not the CCP itself. Banking organizations do not generally calculate Credit Valuation Adjustment (CVA) for cleared transactions or securities financing transactions (SFTs) for financial reporting purposes. The proposal would allow a banking organization to include certain CVA hedges as risk-reducing elements in risk-weighted asset calculations for CVA risk. The proposal includes two approaches for calculating CVA capital requirements: the basic approach (BA-CVA) and the standardized approach (SA-CVA). Under both the BA-CVA and SA-CVA, the proposal would not allow a banking organization to recognize a fraction of an actual transaction as an eligible CVA hedge.
