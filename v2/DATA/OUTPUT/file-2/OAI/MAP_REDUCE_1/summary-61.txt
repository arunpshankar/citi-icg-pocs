The proposal defines delta risk factors for foreign exchange risk as the exchange rate between the market risk covered position's currency and the banking organization's reporting currency. Banking organizations may calculate delta risk factors relative to a base currency instead of the reporting currency, if approved by the primary Federal supervisor. The proposal also defines vega risk factors for foreign exchange risk as the implied volatility of options referencing exchange rates between currency pairs. Banking organizations may treat a currencyâ€™s onshore exchange rate and an offshore exchange rate as two distinct risk factors in the delta, vega, and curvature calculations for foreign exchange risk. The proposal requires banking organizations to calculate risk factor sensitivities using the valuation models used for financial reporting purposes.
