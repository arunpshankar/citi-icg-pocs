The proposed market risk capital framework would require banking organizations to document all aspects of their market risk management, including internal risk transfers and re-designations of positions. The proposal would also require organizations to document their internal models and control processes, as well as their methods for measuring market risk. The proposal would allow banking organizations to use an internal model to calculate risk-based capital requirements, provided they have approval from their primary Federal supervisor. The proposal would also require organizations to establish and document their trading desk structure, including which desks are model-eligible. The proposal would also require additional operational requirements for the models-based measure for market risk, to ensure that the organization has allocated sufficient resources for the desk to develop and rely on internal models that accurately capture the market risk of its positions.
