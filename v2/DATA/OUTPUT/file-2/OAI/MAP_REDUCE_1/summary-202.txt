1. A Board-regulated institution's non-significant investments in unconsolidated financial institutions are treated as tier 2 capital. With the Board's approval, these investments need not be deducted if they are made to support a distressed financial institution.
2. Any non-significant investment not required to be deducted must be assigned the appropriate risk weight. Significant investments in unconsolidated financial institutions that are not common stock must be deducted from capital.
3. With the Board's approval, a Board-regulated institution that underwrites a failed underwriting is not required to deduct the significant investment if it is related to the failed underwriting.
4. A Board-regulated institution must make deductions from regulatory capital as described in the regulations. Deductions must be made from common equity tier 1 capital elements for items that exceed 10% of the institution's common equity tier 1 capital elements, less adjustments and deductions.
5. The institution may recognize the credit risk mitigation benefits of financial collateral that secures an eligible margin loan, repo-style transaction, collateralized derivative contract, or single-product netting set of such transactions, and of any collateral that secures a repo-style transaction that is included in the institution's measure for market risk.
