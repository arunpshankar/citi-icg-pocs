Subordinated debt instruments, including debentures and other debt instruments, are determined by the primary federal supervisor and are subordinated to any creditor of the obligor. These instruments are considered riskier as they rank lower in terms of repayment in the event of bankruptcy or insolvency. The proposal includes both secured and unsecured subordinated debt securities, as subordination may result in the collateral providing little or no value to the debt holder in case of insolvency. The proposal applies a 150 percent risk weight for exposures that meet the definition of a subordinated debt instrument. The proposal seeks comments on the scope of the proposed definition of a subordinated debt instrument and its potential operational challenges for banking organizations.
