The proposal suggests that banking organizations should maintain capital in line with the level and nature of their risk exposure. It proposes replacing the use of internal models for setting regulatory capital requirements for credit risk with a new expanded risk-based approach. This approach would apply the same risk-weight treatment for on-balance sheet exposures, including those to sovereigns, certain supranational entities, and multilateral development banks. The proposal would also introduce new definitions for defaulted exposures and defaulted real estate exposures. The proposal would group credit risk exposures into categories such as sovereign exposures, exposures to certain supranational entities, and multilateral development banks.
