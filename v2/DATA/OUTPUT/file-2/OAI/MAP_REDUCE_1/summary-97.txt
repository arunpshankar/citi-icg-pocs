1. Banking organizations are required to aggregate delta and CVA vega within their respective risk buckets and across risk buckets within each risk class to produce delta and vega risk capital requirements for CVA risk. This is done using prescribed aggregation formulas.
2. The aggregation formula for each risk bucket includes a hedging disallowance parameter to prevent extremely small levels of risk when most risk factors are perfectly hedged. This term provides a floor equal to 10 percent of weighted sensitivities of the standardized CVA hedges.
3. The bucket-level capital requirements are then aggregated across risk buckets within the same risk class. This formula includes a multiplication factor that can be increased by the primary Federal supervisor if the banking organization's CVA model risk warrants such an increase.
4. The overall risk-based capital requirement for CVA risk is the simple sum of the separately calculated risk-class level delta and vega capital requirements across risk classes, without any recognition of diversification benefits.
5. The agencies are proposing a three-year transition period for the expanded risk-based approach and for banking organizations subject to Category III or IV capital standards, the AOCI regulatory capital adjustments. This is to provide banking organizations sufficient time to adjust to the proposal while minimizing potential impact on their ability to lend.
