1. Category I or II capital standards, which provide risk sensitivity and transparency, are proposed to be aligned with Category III or IV capital standards for large banking organizations. This would enhance transparency and consistency in assessing loss absorbency.
2. The proposal requires banking organizations under Category III or IV to recognize most elements of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (AOCI) in regulatory capital, similar to those under Category I or II. This includes applying capital deductions and minority interest treatments.
3. The proposal also includes a three-year transition period for AOCI. Currently, banking organizations under Category I or II are required to include most elements of AOCI in regulatory capital, while those under Category III or IV have the option to opt-out.
4. The proposal would require all net unrealized holding gains and losses on available-for-sale (AFS) debt securities to flow through to common equity tier 1 capital. This would better reflect the loss-absorbing capacity of banking organizations and align with those under Category I or II.
5. The proposal also requires banking organizations under Category III or IV to deduct threshold items from common equity tier 1 capital and apply other capital deductions currently applicable to those under Category I or II. This would create alignment across all banking organizations subject to the proposal.
