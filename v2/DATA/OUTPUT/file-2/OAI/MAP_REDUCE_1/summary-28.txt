The current capital rule defines the attachment point of a securitization exposure as the ratio of the current dollar amount of underlying exposures subordinated to the banking organization's exposure. The proposal would allow a banking organization to recognize all assets, cash or noncash, in a reserve account in the calculation of the attachment point, excluding interest rate and exchange rate derivative contracts. The proposal also modifies the definition of the attachment point to refer to the outstanding balance of the underlying assets rather than the current dollar value. The proposal introduces a delinquency-adjusted, weighted-average capital requirement of the underlying exposures. Lastly, the proposal applies a risk weight floor of 15 percent for securitization exposures that are not resecuritization exposures.
