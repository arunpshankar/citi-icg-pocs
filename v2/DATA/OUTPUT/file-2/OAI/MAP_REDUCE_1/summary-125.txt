1. A banking organization can recognize the credit risk mitigation benefits of an eligible guarantee or credit derivative by substituting the risk weight associated with the protection provider for the risk weight assigned to an exposure. 
2. This applies to exposures fully covered by an eligible guarantee or credit derivative, or covered on a pro rata basis, and to exposures with tranching of credit risk. 
3. If multiple eligible guarantees or credit derivatives cover a single exposure, the banking organization can treat the hedged exposure as multiple separate exposures and calculate a separate risk-weighted asset amount for each. 
4. If an eligible guarantee or credit derivative covers multiple hedged exposures, each exposure must be treated as covered by a separate eligible guarantee or credit derivative and a separate risk-weighted asset amount must be calculated for each. 
5. The banking organization must adjust the effective notional amount of the credit risk mitigant to reflect any maturity mismatch between the hedged exposure and the credit risk mitigant, and apply an adjustment to reduce the effective notional amount of the credit derivative if it does not include restructuring as a credit event.
