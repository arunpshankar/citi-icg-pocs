1. The counterparty credit risk for a national bank or Federal savings association is calculated as the greater of zero and the total fair value of the instruments, gold, or cash that the bank has lent, sold subject to repurchase, or provided as collateral to a counterparty, less the total fair value of the instruments, gold, or cash that the bank has borrowed, purchased subject to resale, or received as collateral from the counterparty.
2. If a national bank or Federal savings association acts as an agent for a repo-style transaction and provides a guarantee to a customer, the amount of the guarantee that is greater than the difference between the fair value of the security or cash its customer has lent and the value of the collateral the borrower has provided is considered.
3. The credit equivalent amount of all off-balance sheet exposures of the national bank or Federal savings association, excluding certain transactions, is determined using the applicable credit conversion factor under ยง 3.112(b), with a minimum credit conversion factor of 10 percent.
4. A clearing member national bank or Federal savings association that guarantees the performance of a clearing member client or a CCP with respect to a cleared transaction must treat its exposure as a derivative contract or repo-style transaction for purposes of determining its total leverage exposure.
