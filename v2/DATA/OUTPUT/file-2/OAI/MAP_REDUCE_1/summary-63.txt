1. The banking organization calculates the curvature risk-weighted sensitivity for interest rate, credit spread, and commodity risk classes by applying upward and downward shocks, assuming a parallel shift of all tenors for each curve based on the highest prescribed delta risk weight for the applicable risk bucket. 
2. For foreign exchange and equity risk classes, the upward and downward shocks represent a relative shift of the foreign exchange spot prices or equity spot prices, respectively, equal to the delta risk weight prescribed for the risk factor. 
3. To aggregate the risk bucket-level capital requirements and risk class-level capital requirements for curvature, a banking organization bifurcates positions into those with positive curvature and those with negative curvature. 
4. After determining the net sensitivity for each of the proposed risk factors within each risk class, a banking organization calculates the risk-weighted sensitivity by multiplying the net sensitivity for each risk factor by the risk weight prescribed for each risk bucket. 
5. The proposed risk weight buckets and associated risk weights are designed to capture the specific, idiosyncratic risks of market risk covered positions and are largely consistent with the Basel III reforms.
