1. The proposed SEC-SA approach would require banking organizations to apply a minimum risk-weight floor of 100 percent for resecuritization exposures, due to their greater complexity and heightened correlation risks. 
2. A minimum risk weight of 100 percent would also apply to Non-Performing Loan (NPL) securitization exposures, which depend heavily on the servicer's ability to generate cashflows from the workout of the underlying exposures. 
3. The proposal includes additional approaches to account for unique features in securitization exposures that could produce inconsistent outcomes under the SEC-SA. 
4. The proposal would not permit banking organizations to recognize any risk-mitigating benefit for nth-to-default credit derivatives, and would require a new treatment for certain interest rate or foreign exchange derivative contracts that qualify as securitization exposures. 
5. The proposal introduces new provisions for overlapping exposures and a "look-through approach" for senior securitization exposures, allowing a banking organization to cap the risk weight applied to a senior securitization exposure at the weighted-average risk weight of the underlying exposures.
