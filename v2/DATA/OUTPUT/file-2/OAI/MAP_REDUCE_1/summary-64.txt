1. The proposed rule outlines risk buckets and corresponding risk weights for credit spread risk factors of non-securitization positions, correlation trading positions, and securitization positions non-CTP. These are grouped into one of nineteen, seventeen, or twenty-five proposed risk buckets, respectively, based on market sector and credit quality.
2. The agencies propose to use the same approach to delta credit spread risk buckets and corresponding risk weights as in the Basel III reforms, but with alternative criteria to capture the creditworthiness of the obligor, in line with the Dodd-Frank Act's requirement to remove references to credit ratings in federal regulations.
3. The proposal includes sectors similar to those in the Basel III reforms and specifies a treatment for certain U.S.-specific sectors, such as GSE debt and public sector entities, which would be included in the sector for government-backed non-financials, education, and public administration.
4. The proposed risk weights are based on empirical data reflecting the historical stress period for which the risk factors within the risk bucket caused the largest cumulative loss at various liquidity horizons. For speculative grade sovereigns and multilateral development banks, the agencies propose a 3 percent risk weight for non-securitization positions and a 13 percent risk weight
