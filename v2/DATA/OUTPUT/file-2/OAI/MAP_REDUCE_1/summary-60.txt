1. The proposal requires banking organizations to construct and use interest rate curves for the currency in which interest rate-sensitive market risk covered positions are denominated. Each curve must be treated as distinct due to basis risk, and onshore and offshore currency curves must also be treated as separate unless prior approval is obtained from a primary Federal supervisor.
2. Additional delta risk factors are required for instruments with cash flows dependent on inflation measures and for instruments with cash flows in different currencies to account for inflation risk and cross-currency basis risk respectively. Banking organizations must consider these risk factors in addition to other delta risk factors for interest rate risk.
3. Vega risk factors for interest rate risk are the implied volatilities of options referencing the interest rate of the underlying instrument. The proposal also defines the curvature risk factors for interest rate risk along one dimension: the interest rate curve of each currency.
4. The proposal separately defines the credit spread risk factors for non-securitization positions, securitization positions that are not correlation trading positions, and correlation trading positions. Vega risk factors for credit spread risk are the implied volatilities of options referencing the credit spreads.
5. The delta risk factors for equity risk and commodity risk are defined for each issuer and each commodity type respectively. The vega
