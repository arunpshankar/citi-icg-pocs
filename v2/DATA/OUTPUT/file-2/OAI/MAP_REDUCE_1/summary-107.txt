The FR Y-14A/Q/M reports are a family of information collections used by the Board to ensure large firms have robust risk management processes and sufficient capital resources. The annual FR Y-14A collects balance sheet, income, losses, and capital projections across various macroeconomic scenarios. The quarterly FR Y-14Q collects granular data on asset classes for the reporting period. The monthly FR Y-14M consists of retail portfolio and loan-level schedules. These reports are mandatory for bank holding companies, U.S. intermediate holding companies, and covered savings and loan holding companies with $100 billion or more in total consolidated assets. The Board is proposing revisions to these reports related to capital, operational risk, and credit risk mitigation, effective from 2025.
