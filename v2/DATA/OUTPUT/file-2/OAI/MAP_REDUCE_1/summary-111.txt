The agencies are inviting comments on how to make notices of proposed rulemaking easier to understand and more organized. They are also seeking feedback on the clarity of the proposed rule's language and format. The Riegle Community Development and Regulatory Improvement Act (RCDRIA) requires that new regulations consider the administrative burdens they would place on depository institutions and their customers, as well as the benefits of such regulations. The OCC has determined that the proposed rule is likely to result in the private sector spending $100 million or more annually. The proposed rule sets forth methodologies for determining expanded total risk-weighted assets for purposes of the expanded capital ratio calculations.
