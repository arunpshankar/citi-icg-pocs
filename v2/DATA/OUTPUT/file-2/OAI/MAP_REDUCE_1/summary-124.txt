1. The calculation of exposure amount (EA) for repo-style transactions between a clearing member and a QCCP (Qualified Central Counterparty) must include the fair value of the independent collateral, adjusted by market price volatility, posted to the QCCP by the clearing member. This includes collateral posted on behalf of a client in connection with a derivative contract for which the clearing member has provided guarantees to the QCCP.
2. The EA must be calculated separately for each clearing member's sub-client accounts and sub-house account. If the clearing member's collateral and its client's collateral are held in the same default fund contribution account, the exposure amount of that account is the sum of the exposure amounts for the client-related and house-related transactions within the account.
3. If any account or sub-account contains both derivative contracts and repo-style transactions, the exposure amount of that account is the sum of the exposure amounts for the derivative contracts and the repo-style transactions within the account. The collateral must be allocated to the derivative contracts and repo-style transactions in proportion to the respective product specific exposure amounts.
4. A banking organization may determine the risk-weighted asset amount for a default fund contribution to a QCCP according to specific regulations, with the prior approval of the relevant agency.
