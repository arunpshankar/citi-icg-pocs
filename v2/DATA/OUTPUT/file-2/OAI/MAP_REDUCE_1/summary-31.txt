The originating bank sells two tranches at a 20% discount, with the first loss tranche sold for $8 million and the senior tranche for $40 million. The investing bank that purchases the first-loss tranche can assign an attachment point of 52% to its exposure, while the bank that purchases the senior tranche can assign an attachment point of 60%. The proposal would replace the existing credit risk mitigation framework with a new one, consistent with the current capital rule, but with some exceptions. Equity exposures present a greater risk of loss relative to credit exposures, and the proposal would generally assign higher risk weights to equity exposures. The proposed framework would maintain sections of the current capital rule's equity framework that do not rely on models, but would make certain modifications to improve risk sensitivity and robustness of the risk-based capital requirements for equity exposures.
