1. A Board-regulated institution's capital conservation buffer is determined by the lowest of three ratios: common equity tier 1 capital ratio, tier 1 capital ratio, and total capital ratio, each minus their respective minimum requirements. If any of these ratios are less than or equal to their minimum requirements, the capital conservation buffer is zero.
2. The leverage buffer for a global systemically important bank holding company (BHC) is its supplementary leverage ratio minus 3 percent. If the supplementary leverage ratio is less than or equal to 3 percent, the leverage buffer is zero.
3. The maximum payout ratio for a Board-regulated institution is determined by its capital buffer, with different percentages applying depending on the buffer's size relative to the institution's buffer requirement.
4. A global systemically important BHC must use its GSIB surcharge to determine its maximum payout ratio.
5. For a Board-regulated institution subject to subpart E, the governing agreement, offering circular, or prospectus of an instrument issued must disclose that the holders of the instrument may be fully subordinated to interests held by the U.S. government in the event of receivership, insolvency, liquidation, or similar proceeding.
