1. The proposal introduces a new method for calculating risk-based capital requirements under the BA-CVA, using a formula that includes parameters for unhedged and hedged risk-based capital requirements, and a regulatory parameter set to 0.25. 
2. The formula sets the capital requirement equal to the weighted average of unhedged and hedged risk, scaled by a factor of 0.65, to ensure the BA-CVA method is calibrated appropriately relative to the SA-CVA. 
3. The proposal also includes a method for calculating the risk-based capital requirements for CVA risk covered positions without recognizing the risk mitigating effect of eligible CVA hedges, for each counterparty on a stand-alone basis. 
4. The proposal assumes a single risk factor drives systematic credit spread risk, and proposes a regulatory correlation parameter of 0.5 to approximate the correlation between the credit spread of a counterparty and the systematic risk factor. 
5. The proposal also outlines the standalone CVA capital requirement for each counterparty, which represents the capital requirement a banking organization would be subject to under the BA-CVA if a single counterparty were the only counterparty with which the banking organization has CVA risk covered positions.
