1. The proposal requires large banking organizations to have an independent operational risk management function. This function would design, implement, and oversee operational loss event data and its collection processes, as well as other aspects of operational risk management. 
2. Large banking organizations would also need to identify, measure, monitor, and control operational risk in their products, activities, processes, and systems, and report operational loss events to management and the board of directors. 
3. The proposal also includes a requirement for banking organizations to collect information on the drivers of operational loss events, with the level of detail commensurate with the size of the gross loss amount. 
4. The proposal would revise existing qualitative disclosure requirements and introduce new ones, removing most of the existing quantitative disclosures from the disclosure tables and including them in regulatory reporting forms instead. 
5. Enhanced public disclosure and reporting requirements would apply to all large banking organizations, promoting transparency for market participants and consistency across organizations. The proposal would also retain and revise certain requirements related to risk management objectives and credit risk.
