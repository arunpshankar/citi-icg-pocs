The document outlines the proposed changes to the reporting, recordkeeping, and disclosure requirements of the regulatory capital rules. The changes include new requirements and revisions to existing ones. New recordkeeping requirements relate to the legal status in bankruptcy of collateral posted to a QCCP, the management of hedged exposures during bankruptcy, reorganization, or restructuring, and the monitoring of operational risk. New reporting requirements are proposed related to the exclusion of certain operational loss data from a banking organization's operational risk calculation. The proposal also includes revisions to existing disclosure requirements and the addition of new ones.
