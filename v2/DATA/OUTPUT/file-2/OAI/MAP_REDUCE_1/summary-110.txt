The proposed rule aims to revise capital requirements for large banking organizations and those with significant trading activity. The revisions aim to improve risk-based capital requirements calculations, reduce complexity, enhance consistency, and facilitate better supervisory and market assessments of capital adequacy. The Board has the authority to establish regulatory capital requirements under the International Lending Supervision Act and the Federal Deposit Insurance Act. The proposed rule would apply to banking organizations with total assets of $100 billion or more and their subsidiary depository institutions, as well as to banking organizations with significant trading activity. The Board believes that the proposed rule would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities supervised by the Board.
