The Board is proposing a revision to the GSIB surcharge calculation and systemic risk report for large banking organizations. The proposal would eliminate the use of internal models for setting credit and operational risk capital requirements for banking organizations subject to Category I or II capital standards. This is due to the unwarranted variability and complexity these models introduce, reducing confidence in the validity of the modeled outputs. Instead, standardized requirements would be used, improving consistency, transparency, and efficiency. The proposal would continue to allow the use of internal models for setting market risk capital requirements where appropriate, and would apply to banking organizations with total assets of $100 billion or more.
