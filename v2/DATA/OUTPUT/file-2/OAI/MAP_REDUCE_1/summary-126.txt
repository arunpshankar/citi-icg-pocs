1. A banking organization must adjust the effective notional amount of any eligible credit derivative to reduce credit risk, using the formula Pr = Pm × 0.60, where Pr is the adjusted effective notional amount and Pm is the original effective notional amount.
2. If a credit derivative is denominated in a different currency from the hedged exposure, the banking organization must adjust for currency mismatch using the formula Pc = Pr × (1- HFX), where Pc is the adjusted effective notional amount, Pr is the original effective notional amount, and HFX is the haircut for the currency mismatch.
3. The banking organization must set HFX equal to eight percent, but may increase it if the guarantee or credit derivative is revalued less frequently than once every 10 business days.
4. To recognize the risk-mitigating effects of financial collateral, a banking organization may use the simple approach for non-derivative exposures or the collateral haircut approach for repo-style transactions, eligible margin loans, or a netting set of such transactions.
5. The banking organization may recognize the credit risk mitigation benefits of financial collateral that secures any exposure that is not a derivative contract or netting set of derivative contracts, provided the collateral meets certain requirements,
