The agencies are seeking feedback on the proposed treatment of exposures secured by second homes, including vacation homes, and residential mortgage exposures where repayment is dependent on cash flows from short-term rentals. The proposal would require a banking organization to use loan-to-value (LTV) ratios to assign a risk weight to a regulatory residential or commercial real estate exposure. The LTV ratio would be calculated as the extension of credit divided by the value of the property. The value of the property would be determined at the time of origination, plus the fair value of any readily marketable collateral and other acceptable collateral. The agencies are also seeking feedback on the benefits and drawbacks of allowing readily marketable collateral and other acceptable collateral to be included in the value for purposes of calculating the LTV ratio.
