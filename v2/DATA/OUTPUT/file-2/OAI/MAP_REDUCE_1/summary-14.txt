The proposed risk weights for regulatory residential real estate exposures are based on the loan-to-value (LTV) ratio and the dependency on the cash flows of the real estate. The agencies are considering whether a 50 percent risk weight would be appropriate for loans originated through a home ownership program that includes risk mitigation features. They are also considering an alternative risk-based capital treatment that does not rely on LTV ratios or dependency upon cash flow. This alternative would incorporate the same treatment for residential mortgage exposures as found in the current U.S. standardized risk-based capital framework. The agencies are also seeking feedback on the impact of these proposals on home affordability and home ownership opportunities, particularly for low- and moderate-income borrowers.
