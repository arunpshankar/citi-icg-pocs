The proposal requires banking organizations to calculate a risk-weighted asset amount for each exposure held by an investment fund. If the organization cannot use the full look-through approach, it must use the alternative modified look-through approach, based on the investment fund's prospectus or similar contract. If neither approach can be applied, the organization must assign a 1,250 percent risk weight to the equity exposure to the investment fund. The full look-through approach is the most granular and risk-sensitive, requiring detailed information about the underlying exposures of the investment fund. The proposal also includes provisions for banking organizations not subject to the proposed market risk capital framework, and maintains the same risk-weight treatment as the current capital rule, with five exceptions.
