1. The Pkl equals 99.9 percent when one delta sensitivity is to an equity spot price and the other is to an equity repo rate, both related to the same equity issuer. When both delta sensitivities are to equity spot prices or equity repo rates, Pki varies between 7.5 percent and 80 percent depending on the assigned buckets.
2. If one delta sensitivity is to an equity spot price and the other is to an equity repo rate, but each is related to a different equity issuer, the applicable correlation parameter equals Pki multiplied by 99.9 percent.
3. For commodity risk, a banking organization must establish buckets for each commodity type as set out in Table 9. Each contract must be assigned to one of the commodity buckets and all contracts with the same underlying commodity must be assigned to the same bucket.
4. The risk weights for calculating risk-weighted delta sensitivities for commodity risk are provided in Table 9. The correlation parameters for aggregating risk-weighted delta sensitivities of commodity risk within a bucket vary between 100 percent and 99 percent depending on the two delta sensitivities.
5. For foreign exchange risk, a banking organization must establish buckets for each exchange rate between the currency in which a market risk covered position
