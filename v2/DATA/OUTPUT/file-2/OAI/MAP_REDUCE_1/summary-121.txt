1. The banking organization must calculate the lowest value, L, of P and K for all option contracts that reference a specific risk factor or instrument. For interest rate option contracts, the lowest value is calculated for each currency. The value of λ is set differently depending on whether the underlying risk factor is an interest rate or not.
2. A banking organization can specify a different value for λ, with prior approval from the agency, for an option contract if it would be more appropriate considering the range of values for the underlying instrument or risk factor. The same value for λ must be assigned to all option contracts with the same underlying instrument or risk factor.
3. For a derivative contract that is a collateralized debt obligation tranche, the supervisory delta adjustment is determined by a specific formula. The formula includes the attachment point, A, and the detachment point, D, which are calculated based on the notional amounts of all underlying exposures.
4. The maturity factor of a derivative contract is determined by different formulas depending on whether the contract is subject to a variation margin agreement or not. The formulas take into account the period from the most recent exchange of collateral until the derivative contracts are closed out and the resulting market risk is re-hedged.
5. A banking organization must separate
