The proposal would require banking organizations to apply a lower capital multiplier to the 60-day average estimated capital required for modellable risk factors. This is based on the number of exceptions in the entity-wide backtesting results. The proposed backtesting requirements would measure the conservatism of the forecasting assumptions and the valuation methods in the expected shortfall models used for determining risk-based capital requirements. The proposal would also require a banking organization's market risk capital requirement to reflect an additional capital requirement for deficiencies in the accuracy of a banking organization's internal models. The agencies propose to require all banking organizations to use the standardized default risk capital requirement regardless of whether they use the IMCC plus SES or the sensitivities-based method plus the residual risk add-on for non-default market risk factors.
