The proposal requires banking organizations to include exposure models for regulatory Credit Valuation Adjustment (CVA) calculation in their risk management framework. The models must be validated annually and in case of sudden market changes. The proposal also requires banking organizations to obtain independent market data for exposure model inputs and maintain data integrity. To calculate CVA risk, the proposal provides a basic measure and a standardized measure. The basic measure includes risk-based capital requirements for all CVA risk covered positions and eligible CVA hedges, while the standardized measure includes risk-based capital requirements calculated under the Standardized Approach-CVA (SA-CVA) and Basic Approach-CVA (BA-CVA).
