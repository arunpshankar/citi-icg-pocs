1. The hedging set amount for both reference entities and commodity types within a hedging set is calculated using a formula that includes the number of entities/types, the sum of adjusted derivative contract amounts, and a supervisory correlation factor. 
2. Banking organizations must calculate separate hedging set amounts for each basis derivative contract hedging set and each volatility derivative contract hedging set, using a formula that corresponds to the primary risk factor of the hedging set. 
3. To calculate the adjusted derivative contract amount, banking organizations must determine the adjusted notional amount of the derivative contract and multiply it by the supervisory delta adjustment, the maturity factor, and the applicable supervisory factor. 
4. The adjusted notional amount for different types of derivative contracts is calculated differently, with specific formulas for interest rate or credit derivative contracts, exchange rate derivative contracts, and equity or commodity derivative contracts. 
5. The supervisory delta adjustment, which is used in the calculation of the adjusted derivative contract amount, varies depending on whether the derivative contract is an option contract, a collateralized debt obligation tranche, or another type of contract.
