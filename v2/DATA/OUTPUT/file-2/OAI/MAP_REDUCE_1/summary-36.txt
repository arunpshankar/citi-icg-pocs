The proposal requires banking organizations to calculate exposure amounts for derivative exposures held by an investment fund. If the organization lacks sufficient information to calculate the replacement cost or potential future exposure for each derivative netting set, it must use the notional amount of each netting set and 15% of the notional amount for the replacement cost and potential future exposure, respectively. The exposure amount is then multiplied by a factor of 1.4 if the counterparty is not a commercial end-user. The exposure amount is further multiplied by a factor of 1.5 for each derivative netting set that qualifies as a CVA risk covered position. The proposal also requires banking organizations to calculate risk-weighted asset amounts for underlying derivative exposures held by an investment fund.
