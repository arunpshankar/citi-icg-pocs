1. A proposed approach for market economy risk buckets aims to increase risk sensitivity by categorizing equities with lower or higher volatility in line with Basel III reforms. This approach allows banking organizations to adjust the list of market economies as more data becomes available.
2. The proposal groups trading positions into one of four sectors for equity risk for both emerging market and liquid market economy categories. These sectors are based on the extent to which equity prices in different sectors are affected by the business cycle.
3. For small market capitalization issuers, volatility is more related to whether the trading position is linked to an emerging market economy or liquid market economy, regardless of the sector. Therefore, the proposed risk buckets for small market capitalization issuers differentiate emerging market economies from liquid market economies but do not differentiate sectors.
4. The proposal includes three risk buckets representing other sectors and equity indices that are both large market capitalization and liquid market economy (non-sector specific). These risk buckets aim to balance the risk sensitivity of these risk buckets and operational burden.
5. The proposal also provides the proposed delta risk buckets and corresponding risk weights for positions with commodity risk. These risk buckets are distinguished by the underlying commodity types to appropriately reflect differences in volatility between those commodity types.
