The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision has proposed reforms to strengthen risk-based capital requirements for large banking organizations. The proposal aims to improve the comprehensiveness and risk sensitivity of these requirements, particularly for organizations with heightened risk profiles. The changes would generally align with international capital standards issued by the Basel Committee, known as the Basel III reforms, but would also reflect specific characteristics of U.S. markets and legal requirements. The proposal would eliminate the use of banking organizations' internal models to set regulatory capital requirements, replacing them with a simpler and more consistent standardized framework. The proposed changes are expected to increase the resilience of the banking sector, supporting more stable lending and reducing the likelihood of financial crises.
