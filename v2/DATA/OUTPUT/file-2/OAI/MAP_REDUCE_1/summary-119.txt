1. A banking organization can choose to treat a cleared derivative contract, not subject to a variation margin agreement, as one that is, if the contract requires daily cash payments between counterparties to account for changes in the contract's fair value. If this election is made for one contract, it must be applied to all eligible contracts within the same netting set.
2. A banking organization can also elect to treat a credit, equity, or commodity derivative contract that references an index as multiple contracts, each referencing one component of the index, provided the contract is not an option or a CDO tranche.
3. For client-facing derivative transactions, a banking organization can multiply the standard supervisory haircuts by the scaling factor of the square root of 1/2. If a longer period is deemed appropriate, a larger scaling factor must be used.
4. The replacement cost of a netting set subject to a variation margin agreement is calculated as the greater of the sum of the fair values of the derivative contracts within the netting set less the sum of the net independent collateral amount and the variation margin amount, or zero.
5. The potential future exposure of a netting set is calculated as the product of the PFE multiplier and the aggregated amount, with the PFE multiplier
