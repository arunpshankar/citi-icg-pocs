The proposed changes in asset class-specific risk weights would only slightly alter banking organizations' portfolio allocations. Large banking organizations may shift asset allocation towards assets with lower risk weights under the proposal, affecting other lenders in the same markets. The proposal requires large banking organizations to maintain equity capital funding at a level at least as high as that required by the U.S. standardized approach. The proposal also raises the risk weights for residential real estate and retail credit exposures to mitigate potential competitive effects. Capital requirements affecting trading activities would increase substantially, potentially enhancing the resilience of bank-affiliated broker dealers and improving market liquidity, but also possibly discouraging certain market-making activities.
