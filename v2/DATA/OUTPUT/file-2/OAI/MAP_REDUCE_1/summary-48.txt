The proposed definition of market risk covered position includes certain internal risk transfers, aiming to promote consistency and comparability in risk-based capital treatment across banking organizations. The proposal continues to exclude from the definition of market risk covered positions any intangible asset, any hedge of a trading position deemed outside the scope of the organization's trading and hedging strategy, and any instrument that acts as a liquidity facility. Direct real estate holdings and non-publicly traded equity positions are also excluded. The proposal excludes from market risk covered positions the CVA segment of an internal risk transfer that is an eligible CVA hedge. The agencies are seeking comments on the appropriateness of the proposed definition and any practical challenges it might pose for banking organizations.
