1. For default derivatives, the n-1 assets with the lowest risk-weighted amounts can be excluded from the risk-weighted capital calculation. However, a banking organization cannot recognize a purchased nth-to-default credit derivative as a credit risk mitigant and must calculate the counterparty credit risk accordingly.
2. For guarantees and credit derivatives other than nth-to-default credit derivatives, a banking organization that provides such a guarantee or credit derivative must risk-weight it as if it held the portion of the reference exposure covered by the guarantee or credit derivative.
3. A banking organization that purchases a credit derivative recognized as a credit risk mitigant is not required to compute a separate counterparty credit risk capital requirement. However, if it cannot or chooses not to recognize a purchased credit derivative as a credit risk mitigant, it must determine the exposure amount of the credit derivative accordingly.
4. A banking organization may assign a risk weight to a senior securitization exposure that is not a resecuritization exposure equal to the greater of the weighted-average risk weight of all the underlying exposures or 15 percent, provided it has knowledge of the composition of all of the underlying exposures.
