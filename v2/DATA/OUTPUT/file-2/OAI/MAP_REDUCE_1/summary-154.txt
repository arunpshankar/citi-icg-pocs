1. Trading positions are defined by the implied volatilities of options along one dimension for the maturity of the option at various intervals. Curvature risk factors for credit spread risk for correlation trading positions are defined along the relevant underlying credit spread curves, disregarding the bond-CDS basis and treating the bond-inferred spread curve and the CDS-inferred spread curve as a single spread curve.
2. Risk factors for equity risk are defined for each issuer and consist of equity spot prices and equity repo rates for delta risk factors, implied volatilities of the spot prices of equity risk-sensitive options for vega risk factors, and all equity spot prices for curvature risk factors.
3. Delta risk factors for commodity risk are all commodity spot prices or forward prices, defined along two dimensions for each commodity: the contracted delivery location and the remaining maturity of the contract. Vega risk factors are the implied volatilities of commodity-sensitive options, and curvature risk factors are defined along one dimension per commodity, the constructed curve per commodity spot prices or forward prices.
4. Delta risk factors for foreign exchange risk are all the exchange rates between the currency in which a market risk covered position is denominated and the reporting currency. Vega risk factors are the implied volatility of options that reference exchange rates between currency pairs
