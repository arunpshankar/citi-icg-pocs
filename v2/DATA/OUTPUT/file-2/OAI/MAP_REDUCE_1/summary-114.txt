Regulatory retail exposure refers to a retail exposure that meets specific criteria, including a product criterion, an aggregate limit of $1 million, and a granularity limit of 0.2 percent of the banking organization's total retail exposures. Retail exposure is an exposure that is not a real estate exposure and is either to a natural person or to a small or medium-sized entity (SME) with annual revenues or sales less than or equal to $50 million. Senior securitization exposure refers to a securitization exposure that has a first-priority claim on the cash flows from the underlying exposures. The loan-to-value (LTV) ratio is calculated as the extension of credit divided by the value of the property. Risk-weighted assets for credit risk are calculated by applying risk weights to exposures, with total credit risk-weighted assets equaling the sum of the risk-weighted asset amounts.
