The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation have proposed a rule change that would significantly revise capital requirements for large banking organizations and those with significant trading activity. The proposed changes aim to improve risk-based capital requirement calculations, reduce complexity, enhance consistency, and facilitate more effective supervisory and market assessments of capital adequacy. The revisions include replacing current requirements that use banking organizations' internal models for credit risk and operational risk with standardized approaches. The proposed changes align with recent changes to international capital standards issued by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision. Public comments on the proposed rule change must be received by November 30, 2023.
