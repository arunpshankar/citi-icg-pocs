Banking organizations must assign risk weights to various types of exposures. For exposures to Public Sector Entities (PSEs) from an OECD member sovereign with no CRC, a 20% risk weight is assigned to a general obligation exposure and a 50% risk weight to a revenue obligation exposure. A 100% risk weight is assigned to an exposure to a PSE whose home country is not an OECD member and does not have a CRC. A 150% risk weight is assigned to a PSE exposure if a sovereign default has occurred in the PSE's home country. Risk weights are also assigned to real estate exposures, with different weights for multifamily mortgages, pre-sold construction loans, high-volatility commercial real estate exposures, and others based on Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratios and whether the exposure is dependent on real estate cash flows.
