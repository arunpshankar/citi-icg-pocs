The formula for IH, the expected shortfall for the market value of an index hedge, is calculated by summing the product of the supervisory risk weight (RW) and the minimum binding derivative finding (Mind. Bind. DFind) for each term. The supervisory risk weight is adjusted based on the sector and credit quality of the index hedge's underlying constituents. The SA-CVA, a standardized approach for CVA risk, is an adaptation of the sensitivities-based method used for market risk. It calculates capital requirements for only delta and vega risk factors, using less granular risk factors and risk buckets, and includes a capital multiplier for model risk. The aggregate regulatory CVA is the sum of counterparty-level regulatory CVAs, reflecting the expected future loss a banking organization would incur on its portfolio of derivatives with a counterparty in the event of the counterparty's default.
