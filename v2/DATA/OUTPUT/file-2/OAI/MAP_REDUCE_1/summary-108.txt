The Board is proposing changes to the reporting of financial items to ensure banking organizations remain compliant with distribution limitations. This includes reporting the expanded risk-based approach versions of the common equity tier 1 capital ratio, tier 1 capital ratio, and total capital ratio. The Board is also proposing to eliminate the opt-out option for recognizing most elements of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (AOCI) in regulatory capital for banking organizations subject to the expanded risk-based standards. Additionally, the Board is proposing to align deduction thresholds across all categories of banking organizations. Lastly, the Board is proposing revisions to the calculation of market risk Risk-Weighted Assets (RWAs), operational risk, and loss events to provide more insight into the drivers of market risk RWAs and to ensure losses are adequately captured over a ten-year timespan.
