Section 1: Data Quality Requirements and Eligibility Test
- Different observation periods allowed for internal and external data, as long as they are the same
- New issuances require a pro-rated number of real prices to pass the risk factor eligibility test
- Quotes of discontinued reference rates can be used until new reference rate liquidity improves
- Modellable risk factors determined by passing eligibility test and meeting data quality requirements
- Data quality requirements include reflecting market prices, capturing systematic and idiosyncratic risk, reflecting volatility and correlation, allowing combinations of risk factors, updating data inputs weekly, using stress period data, and using proxies if appropriate

Section 2: Challenges and Feedback
- Banking organizations may face challenges in meeting data quality requirements for modellable risk factors
- Agencies seeking comments on additional requirements to ensure accurate calculation of potential losses from modellable risk factors
- Requiring weekly updates for IMCC data inputs may pose challenges, concerns can be mitigated by ensuring data integrity
- Re-estimating parameters in line with policies and procedures may pose challenges for banking organizations
- Operational burden of modeling idiosyncratic risk for issuers can be reduced by using data from similar names, but benefits and drawbacks should be considered

Section 3: Liquidity Horizon-Adjusted Expected Shortfall-Based Measures
- Banking organizations to calculate liquidity horizon-adjusted expected shortfall-based measures for risk factors in stress
- Measure for stress period multiplied by ratio based on current period measure, with floor to prevent reduction in capital requirements
- Current period measure must explain at least 75% of variability of losses estimated by full set of risk factors
- Reduced set of risk factors used in calculations must be updated regularly and have sufficient history of observations
- Liquidity horizons assigned to different risk factors based on characteristics, shorter maturities use next longer liquidity horizon

Section 4: Calculation and Stress Periods
- Banking organizations to calculate liquidity horizon-adjusted expected shortfall-based measures for risk factors on a quarterly basis
- Measure calculated at entity-wide level and across risk classes for model-eligible trading desks
- Calculation involves scaling up 10-day base expected shortfall measure using longer proposed liquidity horizons for modellable risk factors within same risk class
- Banking organizations to review and update stress period regularly to reflect changes in risk factors
- Seeking feedback on using same set of risk factors to identify stress periods and calculate capital requirements

Section 5: Capital Requirements and Treatment of Risk Factors
- Proposal includes using liquidity horizon-adjusted expected shortfall-based measures to calculate capital requirements for modellable risk factors
- Stressed expected shortfall used for non-modellable risk factors with less recognition for hedging and portfolio diversification
- Backtesting requirements for VaR-based measures, with modifications to include hypothetical profit and loss comparisons
- Seeking comment on treatment of non-modellable risk factors and potential use of multiplier to better reflect their risk profile
- Lower capital multiplier for banking organizations based on number of exceptions in backtesting results to measure conservatism of forecasting assumptions and valuation methods

Section 6: PLA Testing and Securitization Positions
- PLA add-on imposes additional capital requirement on model-eligible trading desks with deficiencies in internal models
- Banking organizations to compare daily profit and loss values from internal risk management models against hypothetical profit and loss from front office models
- Inclusion of securitization positions for PLA tests
- Proposal aims to improve PLA test metrics for model-eligible trading desks, including Spearman correlation and Kolmogorov-Smirnov metric
- Treatment of net short risk positions and calculation of exposure on quarterly basis

Section 7: Capital Rule Streamlining and Disclosures
- Streamlining of capital rule for banking organizations subject to market risk framework
- Elimination of certain quantitative disclosures, retention of disclosures related to securitization positions and correlation trading positions
- Introduction of new quantitative disclosures comparing VaR-based estimates to actual gains or losses
- Revised qualitative disclosures to include information on expected shortfall and risk management policies
- Reporting and disclosure requirements for compliance with market risk capital framework

Section 8: Securitization Exposures and CVA Risk
- Clarification on securitization exposures and capital requirements
- Capital requirements for credit valuation adjustment (CVA) risk for large banking organizations
- Calculation of CVA risk for cleared transactions and securities financing transactions
- Introduction of CVA hedges and requirements for their recognition
- Two approaches for calculating CVA capital requirements: basic approach (BA-CVA) and standardized approach (SA-CVA)

Section 9: Risk Management and Calculation of CVA Risk
- Risk management requirements for identifying and managing CVA risk positions and hedges
- Clearly defined hedging policy and documentation of risk management processes
- Compliance with operational requirements for banking organizations using standardized measure for CVA risk
- Alignment of regulatory CVA with accounting CVA and use of CVA models for calculating regulatory CVA
- Ongoing eligibility requirements and control measures for CVA risk management

Section 10: Exposure Models and Capital Requirements for CVA Risk
- Inclusion of exposure models for regulatory CVA calculation in risk management framework
- Validation process for models, including exposure models, and testing against independent benchmarks
- Calculation of capital requirements for CVA risk using basic measure and standardized measure
- Option for banking organizations to use standardized measure if approved by primary Federal supervisor
- Seeking feedback on appropriateness of risk weights and calibration factor used in capital requirement formula for CVA risk

Section 11: Calculation of Regulatory CVA and Risk Weights
- Calculation of regulatory CVA based on counterparty-level regulatory CVAs
- Inputs required for regulatory CVA calculation, including term structure and simulated paths
- Assumption that derivative contracts have same seniority as senior unsecured bonds
- Recognition of financial collateral as risk mitigant if requirements are met
- Calculation of risk-based capital requirements for CVA risk under basic approach (BA-CVA)

Section 12: Calculation of Delta and Vega Risk Capital Requirements
- Calculation of risk-based capital requirements for delta and vega to capture linear CVA risks
- Risk classes for different types of risk factors and calculation of sensitivities
- Treatment of counterparty credit spread risk as separate delta risk class
- Calculation of sensitivities for risk factors and counterparty credit spread delta risk factors
- Introduction of standardized approach for CVA risk with specific risk weights and correlations

Section 13: Aggregation of Delta and CVA Vega Risk Capital Requirements
- Aggregation of net weighted sensitivities for each risk bucket and across risk buckets within each risk class
- Formulas for aggregation, including parameters such as regulatory correlation and hedging disallowance
- Capital requirements calculated separately for each risk class and then aggregated across risk classes
- Transition provisions for expanded risk-weighted assets and adjustments to regulatory capital over three-year period
- Impact and economic analysis of proposal considered, with expected slight reduction in bank lending but increased financial system resilience
