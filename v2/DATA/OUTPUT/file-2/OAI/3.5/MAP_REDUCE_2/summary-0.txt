Section 1: Proposed Revisions to Capital Requirements for Large Banking Organizations
- The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal Reserve System, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation are proposing revisions to the capital requirements for large banking organizations and those with significant trading activity.
- The proposed revisions aim to improve risk-based capital requirements, reduce complexity, enhance consistency, and facilitate better supervision and market assessments.
- The revisions would replace current requirements with standardized approaches and align with international capital standards.
- The proposal does not affect smaller, less complex banking organizations.
- Public comments on the proposal are invited until November 30, 2023.

Section 2: Key Changes in Capital Requirements
- The proposal removes the use of internal models for credit and operational risk capital requirements to improve consistency and transparency.
- Standardized requirements and robust public disclosure enhance the transparency of capital requirements.
- Large banking organizations are still required to maintain capital commensurate with their risks and conduct stress tests.
- The proposal increases the dollar-based threshold for market risk requirements and revises the calculation method.
- The proposal expands the application of the countercyclical capital buffer and the supplementary leverage ratio requirement to certain banking organizations.
- An "output floor" is introduced to ensure consistency in capital requirements and prevent unwarranted reductions in capital.
- The proposal includes a stress capital buffer requirement to maintain capital ratios above minimum requirements.

Section 3: Changes to Definition of Capital and Risk Weight Treatments
- The proposal includes changes to the definition of capital for certain banking organizations.
- AOCI (Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income) is included in regulatory capital to reflect the actual loss-absorbing capacity of banking organizations.
- Nonsignificant investments in unconsolidated financial institutions and minority interest treatments are subject to deduction requirements.
- The proposal provides guidance on due diligence for credit risk portfolios and the risk-weight treatment for on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet exposures.

Section 4: Risk Weight Treatments for Different Exposures
- The proposal suggests risk weights for different types of real estate exposures based on their characteristics.
- Risk weights for residential and commercial real estate exposures depend on factors such as loan-to-value ratio and dependence on cash flows.
- The proposal introduces risk weight treatments for retail exposures based on product type and portfolio diversification.
- Risk weights for project finance exposures and off-balance sheet exposures are also addressed in the proposal.

Section 5: Credit Risk Mitigants and Collateral Recognition
- The proposal eliminates the use of models for credit risk and replaces them with standardized approaches.
- Requirements for the recognition of credit protection from guarantees, credit derivatives, and collateralized transactions are included.
- The proposal defines netting sets and includes requirements for the recognition of certain debt securities as financial collateral.
- The proposed methodology for calculating gross exposure balances simplicity and risk sensitivity.

Section 6: Other Key Proposals
- The proposal addresses the treatment of credit derivatives without restructuring and collateralized transactions.
- Specific haircuts for securitization exposures, equities, gold, and collateral in the form of mutual fund shares are introduced.
- Minimum haircut floors are proposed for eligible margin loans and repo-style transactions with unregulated financial institutions.
