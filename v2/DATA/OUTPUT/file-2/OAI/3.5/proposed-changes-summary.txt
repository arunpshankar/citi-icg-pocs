23. The scope of application and definition of market risk covered positions would be expanded to include equity positions in investment funds, net short risk positions, publicly traded equity positions, and embedded derivatives.
24. Internal risk transfers would be defined, and requirements for their recognition in risk-based capital requirements would be established.
25. Data quality requirements and an eligibility test would be introduced for internal and external data used in risk factor eligibility and modellable risk factors.
26. Challenges and feedback related to data quality requirements and weekly updates for IMCC data inputs would be addressed.
27. Liquidity horizon-adjusted expected shortfall-based measures would be calculated for risk factors in stress, with a ratio-based adjustment to the stress period measure.
28. Calculation and stress periods for liquidity horizon-adjusted expected shortfall-based measures would be established, with regular updates to reflect changes in risk factors.
29. Capital requirements and treatment of risk factors would be based on liquidity horizon-adjusted expected shortfall-based measures for modellable risk factors and stressed expected shortfall for non-modellable risk factors.
30. PLA testing and securitization positions would be included in the calculation of risk capital requirements.
31. Capital rule streamlining and disclosures would be revised, including the elimination of certain quantitative disclosures and the introduction of new quantitative and qualitative disclosures.

33. Risk management and calculation of CVA risk would be addressed, including the use of exposure models and ongoing eligibility requirements.
34. Calculation of regulatory CVA and risk weights would be based on counterparty-level regulatory CVAs and inputs such as term structure and simulated paths.
35. Calculation of delta and vega risk capital requirements would be based on sensitivities to risk factors and risk weights, with treatment of default risk and securitization positions.
36. Aggregation of delta and CVA vega risk capital requirements would be based on net weighted sensitivities and formulas for aggregation.
37. Calculation of risk-based capital requirements for delta, vega, and curvature risk would be based on sensitivities, risk weights, and correlation parameters.
