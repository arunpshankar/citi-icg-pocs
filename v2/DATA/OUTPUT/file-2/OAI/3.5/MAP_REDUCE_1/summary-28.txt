The current capital rule for securitization exposures calculates the attachment point based on the ratio of subordinated underlying exposures to the banking organization's exposure. The proposal would allow all assets in a reserve account, cash or noncash, to be included in the calculation of the attachment point. However, interest rate and exchange rate derivative contracts and their cash collateral accounts would not be included. The definition of attachment point would be modified to refer to the outstanding balance of underlying assets instead of the current dollar value. Parameter W, which reflects the proportion of nonperforming or delinquent underlying exposures, would be defined similarly for resecuritization exposures, excluding securitization exposures from the numerator. The delinquency-adjusted and non-adjusted weighted-average capital requirement of underlying exposures would be calculated using KG and W. A supervisory parameter of 1.0 would be applied to securitization exposures and 1.5 to resecuritization exposures. A risk weight floor of 15 percent would be applied to securitization exposures that are not resecuritization exposures.
