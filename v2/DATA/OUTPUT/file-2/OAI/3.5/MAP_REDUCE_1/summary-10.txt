The proposal suggests categorizing bank exposures based on the credit risk of the obligor depository institution, foreign bank, or credit union. The categories are Grade A, Grade B, and Grade C. Grade A exposures are investment grade with publicly disclosed capital ratios that meet or exceed certain requirements. Grade B exposures are either speculative grade or investment grade with publicly disclosed capital ratios that meet certain requirements. Grade C exposures do not meet the criteria for Grade A or Grade B exposures. The proposal also introduces risk weight treatment for subordinated debt instruments, defining them as debt securities with heightened credit risk that are not equity exposures.
