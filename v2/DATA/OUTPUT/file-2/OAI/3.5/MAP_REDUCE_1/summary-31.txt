1. If a bank sells tranches of a securitization at a 20% discount, the investing bank can assign an attachment point of 52% to the first-loss tranche and 60% to the senior tranche.
2. The proposal would replace the current credit risk mitigation framework for securitization exposures with a framework consistent with the existing capital rule, with one exception.
3. Equity exposures have a higher risk of loss compared to credit exposures, and the proposal assigns higher risk weights to equity exposures.
4. The proposal does not include an internal models approach for equity exposures and instead requires banking organizations to use a standardized approach.
5. The proposal retains the risk-weighted asset amount calculation under the current capital rule for equity exposures.
