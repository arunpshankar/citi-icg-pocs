The proposal discusses the risk of a CCP participant defaulting and the responsibility of clearing members to cover losses. It states that banking organizations are subject to capital requirements for this risk. The proposal also mentions that CVA (credit valuation adjustment) is not calculated for cleared transactions or securities financing transactions. It introduces the concept of CVA hedges and sets requirements for their recognition. The proposal includes two approaches for calculating CVA capital requirements: the basic approach (BA-CVA) and the standardized approach (SA-CVA). It also outlines general risk management requirements and seeks comments on the interpretation of "region" for BA-CVA purposes.
