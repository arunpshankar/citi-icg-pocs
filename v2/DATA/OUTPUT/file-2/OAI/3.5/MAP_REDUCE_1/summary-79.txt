The agencies are seeking feedback on the proposed requirement for banking organizations to use the same set of risk factors to identify stress periods and calculate capital requirements. They want to know if this approach allows for sufficient flexibility to capture risk factors in different stress periods and if there are alternative approaches to consider. The proposal includes using liquidity horizon-adjusted expected shortfall-based measures to calculate capital requirements for modellable risk factors and stressed expected shortfall for non-modellable risk factors. The calculation for non-modellable risk factors would have less recognition for hedging and portfolio diversification. The proposal also includes backtesting requirements for VaR-based measures, with modifications to include hypothetical profit and loss comparisons. The agencies are seeking comment on the treatment of non-modellable risk factors and whether a multiplier should be used to better reflect their risk profile.
