An FDIC-supervised institution that has elected the 2020 CECL transition provision may increase its total leverage exposure for the supplementary leverage ratio during the transition period. Certain sections of subpart H of the FDI Act apply to FDIC-supervised institutions and insured branches of foreign banks. Total assets for subpart H are calculated using an institution's quarterly average total assets reported in the Call Report. An FDIC-supervised institution subject to subpart E will be deemed "adequately capitalized" if it satisfies certain requirements and has a supplementary leverage ratio of 3.0 percent or greater. An FDIC-supervised institution subject to subpart E will be deemed "undercapitalized" if it has a supplementary leverage ratio of less than 3.0 percent. Amendments are made to various sections of 12 CFR part 324 to reflect the changes.
