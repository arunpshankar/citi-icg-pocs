1. A banking organization must measure the CVA vega sensitivity to each vega risk factor for interest rate risk and commodity risk.
2. The banking organization may use smaller values of risk factor changes if consistent with internal risk management calculations.
3. When calculating CVA vega sensitivities, the volatility shift must apply to both volatilities used for generating risk factor paths and pricing options.
4. For standardized CVA risk covered positions or hedges referencing an index, the sensitivities to all risk factors upon which the index depends must be calculated.
5. Additional risk factors may be introduced for counterparty credit spread risk, reference credit spread risk, and equity risk, and the sensitivity to qualified index risk factors must be calculated.
