The proposal allows for different observation periods for internal and external data, as long as they are the same. New issuances require a pro-rated number of real prices to pass the risk factor eligibility test. Quotes of discontinued reference rates can be used until the new reference rate liquidity improves. Modellable risk factors are determined by passing the eligibility test and meeting data quality requirements. Data quality requirements include reflecting market prices, capturing systematic and idiosyncratic risk, reflecting volatility and correlation, allowing combinations of risk factors, updating data inputs weekly, using stress period data, and using proxies if appropriate.
