The proposal requires large banking organizations to have an independent operational risk management function. They must collect and oversee operational loss event data and have processes to identify, measure, monitor, and control operational risk. They are also required to report operational loss events and other relevant information to management and the board of directors. The proposal includes revisions to disclosure requirements, introducing new qualitative disclosures and removing most quantitative disclosures. Enhanced disclosure requirements would apply to all large banking organizations, promoting transparency and consistency. The proposal also includes specific disclosure requirements for credit risk and counterparty credit risk-related exposures.
