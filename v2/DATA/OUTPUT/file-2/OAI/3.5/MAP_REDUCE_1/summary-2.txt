The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision has proposed additional reforms to strengthen risk-based capital requirements for large banking organizations. These reforms would align with international capital standards but also reflect specific characteristics of the US market. The proposal aims to increase the comprehensiveness and risk sensitivity of capital requirements, particularly for banking organizations with higher risk profiles. The agencies expect that the benefits of strengthening capital requirements outweigh the costs. The proposal also includes enhanced disclosure requirements and aligns regulatory reporting requirements with the changes to capital requirements.
