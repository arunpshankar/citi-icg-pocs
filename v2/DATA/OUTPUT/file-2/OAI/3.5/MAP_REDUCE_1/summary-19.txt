The proposed averaging methodology for calculating undrawn credit exposure would use a multiplier of 10 based on the average credit utilization rates of similar obligors. It would use an eight-quarter average balance to better reflect a borrower's credit usage and mitigate the impact of seasonality and short-term trends. Adjustments may be needed for commitments with less than eight quarters of data. The proposal also simplifies the credit conversion factors for commitments, with a 40% factor for most commitments and a 10% factor for unconditionally cancellable commitments. The agencies are considering additional factors for determining credit conversion factors. The proposal expands the use of the SA-CCR approach for measuring the exposure amount of derivative contracts and makes technical revisions to improve consistency and reflect counterparty credit risks. It also changes the treatment of collateral held by a qualifying central counterparty and collateral held in a bankruptcy-remote manner.
