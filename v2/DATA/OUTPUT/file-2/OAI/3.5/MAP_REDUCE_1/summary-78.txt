The proposal requires banking organizations to calculate liquidity horizon-adjusted expected shortfall-based measures for risk factors on a quarterly basis. This is to ensure that the stress period chosen accurately reflects potential losses over time. The measure is calculated at both the entity-wide level and across risk classes for model-eligible trading desks. The calculation involves scaling up the 10-day base expected shortfall measure using longer proposed liquidity horizons for modellable risk factors within the same risk class. The banking organization must also review and update the stress period regularly to reflect changes in risk factors.
