(3) Exposures with tranching of credit risk are securitization exposures subject to specific regulations.
(4) If multiple guarantees or credit derivatives cover a single exposure, the banking organization can treat each covered exposure separately and calculate a separate risk-weighted asset amount for each.
(5) If a single guarantee or credit derivative covers multiple exposures, the banking organization must treat each exposure separately and calculate a separate risk-weighted asset amount for each.
