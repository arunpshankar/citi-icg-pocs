The proposed market risk capital framework would require banking organizations to have clearly defined policies and procedures for actively managing all positions subject to the market risk capital rule. This includes daily monitoring of position limits and the establishment of internal controls and authorization procedures. The proposal also specifies a broader set of risk metrics for monitoring at the trading desk level, including trading limits, sensitivities to risk factors, and VaR and expected shortfall. Banking organizations with model-eligible trading desks would be required to establish and monitor backtesting and p-values. Stress testing and internal assessment of capital adequacy would also be enhanced, with banking organizations required to conduct stress tests at both the entity-wide and trading-desk level on a quarterly basis. Control and oversight requirements would be maintained, with an expanded role for the independent risk control unit and enhanced internal review and challenge responsibilities. Documentation requirements would also be enhanced to reflect the proposed changes.
