Under the proposal, banking organizations would calculate liquidity horizon-adjusted expected shortfall-based measures for risk factors in stress. The measure for the stress period would be multiplied by a ratio based on the current period measure and a floor would be set to prevent a reduction in capital requirements. The proposal also requires the current period measure to explain at least 75% of the variability of losses estimated by the full set of risk factors. The reduced set of risk factors used in the calculations must be updated regularly and have a sufficient history of observations. Liquidity horizons would be assigned to different risk factors based on their characteristics and instruments with shorter maturities would use the next longer liquidity horizon.
