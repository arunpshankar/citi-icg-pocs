The proposal defines a subordinated debt instrument as a debt security that is subordinate to other creditors in the event of bankruptcy or insolvency. It includes both secured and unsecured debt securities. The risk weight for subordinated debt instruments would be 150 percent. Real estate exposures are categorized into different types, such as residential mortgage, commercial real estate, and acquisition/development/construction (ADC) exposures. The risk weight for these exposures depends on factors such as the type of real estate and the loan-to-value ratio. The proposal aims to differentiate the credit risk of real estate exposures based on existing information collected by banking organizations.
