The information provided explains the calculation of curvature risk positions and the aggregation of these positions within and across buckets. It also outlines the calculation of delta sensitivities, vega sensitivities, and curvature scenarios for the purpose of determining capital requirements. The calculation involves applying upward and downward shocks to risk factors and determining the net curvature risk position for each market risk covered position. The size of the shock, or risk weight, is specified in the regulations. The aggregation of curvature risk positions is done using correlation parameters, and different correlation scenarios are considered. The calculation of delta sensitivities, vega sensitivities, and curvature scenarios is based on valuation models used for financial reporting, with the option to use internal risk management models with prior approval.
