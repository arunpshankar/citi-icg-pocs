The proposed definition of a real price would require additional requirements for prices or other information obtained from third parties to demonstrate market liquidity and ensure validity. Banking organizations can choose their own bucketing approach or use the standard bucketing approach to determine if a risk factor satisfies the eligibility test. The number of risk factor buckets should be based on the organization's trading strategies. Banking organizations can define more granular risk factor buckets under their own approach but would need to source sufficient real prices. Internal models can decompose risks associated with credit or equity indices into systematic risk factors, but idiosyncratic risk factors would be non-modellable if there aren't enough real prices. A banking organization must allocate real prices to risk buckets and count all real prices mapped to a risk bucket to determine if risk factors pass the eligibility test. The criteria for risk factor eligibility aim to capture trading activity and prevent outdated prices from being used. Banking organizations can use a different time period for the eligibility test if it is not greater than one month compared to the time period used for the current expected shortfall model.
