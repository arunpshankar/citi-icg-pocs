The proposal suggests that the operational risk capital requirement would increase at a decreasing rate with an increase in average annual total net operational losses. The calculation of these losses would be based on a ten-year average to balance changes in operational risk exposure over time. The proposal defines an operational loss as all losses resulting from an operational loss event, excluding certain costs. Operational loss events are classified into seven event types, and a $20,000 net loss threshold is set for inclusion in the calculation. The proposal also clarifies the treatment of operational losses relative to typical practice under the AMA and includes revisions to the FR Y-14Q report.
