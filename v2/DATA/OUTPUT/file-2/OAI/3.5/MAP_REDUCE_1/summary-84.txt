The proposal requires banking organizations to apply the look-through approach when calculating the default risk capital requirement for equity positions in investment funds, except for certain cases where the hypothetical portfolio approach or fall back method is used. For publicly traded real estate investment trusts, the exposures would be treated as a single exposure. The proposal aims to ensure consistent and appropriate capture of default risk while minimizing operational burden. The agencies seek comments on specific measures and methodologies to capture index positions and residual risks in investment funds. The proposal also allows banking organizations to use internal models approach for equity positions in investment funds if the underlying positions can be identified quarterly. Term repo-style transactions can be included in market risk covered positions if marked to market consistently over time, with specific requirements for capturing risk factors and default risk. The proposal includes reporting and disclosure requirements for banking organizations to ensure compliance with the market risk capital framework.
