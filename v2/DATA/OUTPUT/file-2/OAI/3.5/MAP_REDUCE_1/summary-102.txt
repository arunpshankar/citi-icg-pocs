The information provided discusses proposed amendments to the eSLR rule and the capital rule by the OCC and FDIC. The eSLR rule currently applies to national banks and Federal savings associations that are subsidiaries of U.S. top-tier bank holding companies with over $700 billion in consolidated assets or over $10 trillion in assets under custody. The proposed amendments aim to align the eSLR standard with the Board's regulations for identifying U.S. GSIBs. The FDIC is also proposing technical amendments to certain provisions of the capital rule. The Board is separately issuing a proposal to amend the framework for identifying and establishing risk-based surcharges for GSIBs. The proposed amendments are subject to review and approval by the Office of Management and Budget.
