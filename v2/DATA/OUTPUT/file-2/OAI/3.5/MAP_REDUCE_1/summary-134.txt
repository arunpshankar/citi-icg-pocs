(1) When determining the risk-weighted asset amount for an equity exposure to an investment fund held by another investment fund, a banking organization can use the full look-through approach, the alternative modified look-through approach, or apply a 1,250 percent risk weight.
(2) The risk-weighted assets for operational risk for a banking organization equals the operational risk capital requirement multiplied by 12.5.
(3) The operational risk capital requirement is calculated by multiplying the Business Indicator Component by the Internal Loss Multiplier.
(4) The Business Indicator Component is calculated based on the banking organization's business indicator, which is the sum of three components: interest, lease, and dividend component; services component; and financial component.
(5) The Internal Loss Multiplier is calculated based on the average annual total net operational losses and the Business Indicator Component.
