The proposal aims to streamline the capital rule for banking organizations subject to the market risk framework. It would eliminate certain quantitative disclosures related to risk calculations, but retain disclosures related to securitization positions and correlation trading positions. The proposal also introduces new quantitative disclosures comparing VaR-based estimates to actual gains or losses. Qualitative disclosures would be revised to include information on models used to calculate expected shortfall and risk management policies. The proposal also requires banking organizations to provide quarterly public regulatory reports and submit confidential supervisory reports on backtesting and PLA testing. Additionally, the proposal includes technical amendments to streamline definitions related to securitizations.
