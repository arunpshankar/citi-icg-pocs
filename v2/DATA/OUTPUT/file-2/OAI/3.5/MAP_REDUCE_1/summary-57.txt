If a trading desk does not receive approval to use internal models or fails to meet operational requirements, it must use the standardized approach to calculate market risk capital requirements. The proposed standardized measure for market risk aims to capture a banking organization's actual market risk exposure while minimizing compliance burden. It also promotes comparability in market risk capital requirements across banking organizations. Model-eligible trading desks must meet specific criteria to use internal models, while model-ineligible desks use the standardized approach. The models-based measure for market risk includes various components, such as capital requirements for different types of desks and additional capital requirements for shortcomings in internal models. The fallback capital requirement applies when a banking organization cannot calculate market risk requirements using the standardized or internal models approach.
