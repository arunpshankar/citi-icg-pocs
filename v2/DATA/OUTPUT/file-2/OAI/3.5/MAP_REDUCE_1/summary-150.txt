A banking organization must calculate bucket-level risk positions separately for delta risk, vega risk, and curvature risk by aggregating risk-weighted sensitivities. The risk class-level capital requirement is the sum of the delta, vega, and curvature capital requirements for each risk class. The sensitivities-based capital requirement is the largest capital requirement produced under three correlation scenarios. The delta capital requirement is calculated by multiplying delta sensitivities by risk weights and aggregating them. The vega capital requirement is calculated in a similar manner, but for vega sensitivities. The curvature capital requirement is calculated by applying upward and downward shocks to each risk factor and calculating the incremental loss.
