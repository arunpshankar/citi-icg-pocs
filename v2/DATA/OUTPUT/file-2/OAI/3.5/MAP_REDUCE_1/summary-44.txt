In January 2016, a new framework was published that established minimum capital requirements for market risk and increased transparency of banking organizations' market-risk-weighted assets. In January 2019, an amended framework was published that revised the calibration of risk weights to better capture potential losses for certain types of risks. The proposal aims to improve the risk-sensitivity and calibration of market risk capital requirements by introducing a standardized methodology and a new models-based methodology. The proposal also restricts the use of internal models to trading desks and replaces the VaR-based measure of market risk with an expected shortfall-based measure. If a trading desk fails to meet certain requirements, the banking organization must use the standardized measure for market risk.
