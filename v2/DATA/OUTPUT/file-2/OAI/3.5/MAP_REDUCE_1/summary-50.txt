The proposal outlines the capital treatment of internal risk transfers between a CVA desk and a trading desk to hedge CVA risk. The CVA desk must have a dedicated desk or equivalent to manage internal risk transfers. The proposal requires a written record of each internal derivative transaction, including identifying the underlying exposure being hedged. If the internal risk transfer is subject to certain risks, the trading desk must execute an external transaction to perfectly offset the risk. The proposal sets forth general requirements for the recognition of CVA hedges. The proposal does not allow recognition of risk mitigation benefits for internal equity risk transfers.
