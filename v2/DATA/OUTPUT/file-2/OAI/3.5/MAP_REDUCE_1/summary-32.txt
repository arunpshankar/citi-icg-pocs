1. The proposal suggests using a 40 percent conversion factor to calculate the adjusted carrying value of conditional commitments to acquire an equity exposure.
2. The risk-weighted asset amount for equity exposures would be determined by multiplying the adjusted carrying value by the lowest applicable risk weight in Table 2.
3. The proposal eliminates certain risk weights in the current capital rule's simple risk-weight approach and introduces new risk weights for different types of equity exposures.
4. The 100 percent risk weight for non-significant equity exposures is removed, and a 250 percent risk weight is assigned to publicly traded equity exposures with restrictions on tradability.
5. Equity exposures that qualify as community development investments or small business investment companies would still receive a 100 percent risk weight.
