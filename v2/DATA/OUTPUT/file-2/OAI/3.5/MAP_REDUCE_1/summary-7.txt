The current capital rule requires banking organizations to deduct nonsignificant investments in unconsolidated financial institutions that exceed 10% of their common equity tier 1 capital. Significant investments in unconsolidated financial institutions must be deducted in their entirety. The proposal would extend these deduction requirements to banking organizations subject to Category III or IV capital standards. The current capital rule also limits the amount of minority interest that banking organizations can include in regulatory capital, and the proposal would apply these limitations to banking organizations subject to Category III or IV capital standards. The proposal also includes changes to the definition of tier 2 capital for large banking organizations, including the use of adjusted allowance for credit losses (AACL) instead of allowance for loan and lease losses (ALLL). The proposal also provides guidance on due diligence for credit risk portfolios and the risk-weight treatment for on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet exposures.
