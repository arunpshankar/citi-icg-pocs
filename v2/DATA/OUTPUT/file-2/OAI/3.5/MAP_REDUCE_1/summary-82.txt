The proposal discusses the cliff effect that occurs when a trading desk transitions from using internal models to the standardized approach for market risk capital requirements. If a trading desk fails the PLA test, it must use the standardized approach for calculating market risk capital requirements. Backtesting requirements are also discussed, with specific criteria for exceptions that would make a trading desk model-ineligible. Non-modellable risk factors and challenges related to calculating capital requirements for modellable risk factors are addressed. The proposal also clarifies the treatment of net short risk positions and requires banking organizations to calculate their exposure on a quarterly basis. Finally, the treatment of securitization positions and defaulted/distressed market risk covered positions is discussed.
