The proposal requires banking organizations to calculate a risk-weighted asset amount for each exposure held by an investment fund. If a banking organization cannot use the full look-through approach, they must use the alternative modified look-through approach and determine the risk-weighted asset amount based on information from the investment fund's prospectus or partnership agreement. If neither approach can be used, a 1,250 percent risk weight is assigned to the equity exposure. The full look-through approach is required when detailed information about the underlying exposures is available, and the information must be verified by an independent third party. The proposal maintains the same risk-weight treatment as the current capital rule, with some exceptions.
