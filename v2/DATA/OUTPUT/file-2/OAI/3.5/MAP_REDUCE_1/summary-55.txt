The proposal aims to ensure that the internal models used by banking organizations accurately reflect the risks of market risk covered positions. It requires validation of outcomes analysis at both the aggregated level and the trading desk level. Documentation requirements include policies and procedures for risk factor eligibility, data alignment, and risk factor assignment. Approval to use internal models must be obtained from the primary Federal supervisor, and trading desks must meet certain criteria to be eligible. Ongoing eligibility requires prior approval for changes to trading desk structure or internal models, and trading desks must pass quarterly backtesting and PLA testing.
