The proposed requirements would ensure that credit derivatives without restructuring as a credit event are recognized similarly to those with restructuring provisions. The agencies are seeking comments on the appropriateness of recognizing the full notional amount of such credit derivatives if certain conditions are met. The proposal also addresses the treatment of eligible credit derivatives without restructuring outside of the United States. For collateralized transactions, the proposal allows recognition of risk-mitigating benefits only for corporate debt securities issued by corporations with publicly traded securities. The proposal maintains the simple approach for collateral eligibility but introduces modifications to the collateral haircut approach.
