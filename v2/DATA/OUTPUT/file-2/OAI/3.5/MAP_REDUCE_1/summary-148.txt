(i) A banking organization must use the look-through approach for index instruments and multi-underlying options in calculating market risk. This approach allows for netting of scenarios and sensitivities without restriction. It must be applied consistently for all positions referencing the same index.
(ii) However, for listed and well-diversified indices, the banking organization may choose not to use the look-through approach. Instead, a single sensitivity is calculated for the index and assigned to the corresponding sector or index bucket based on certain criteria.
(iii) For vega capital requirement calculations, the banking organization may use either the implied volatility of the option or the implied volatility of options on the underlying constituents. The same sector or index bucket used for delta and curvature capital requirements must be used.
(iv) In the standardized default risk capital requirement calculation, the look-through approach can be applied for non-securitization debt or equity positions in multi-underlying options.
(v) For equity positions in investment funds, the banking organization can use the look-through approach or treat the fund as a hypothetical portfolio. Different methods can be used depending on the fund's characteristics and risk weights.
