The proposal aims to limit the increase in capital requirements for market risk by capping the sum of three components for trading desks subject to different approaches. There are four other components that would only apply in limited circumstances, including capital requirements for model-eligible desks and additional requirements established by the primary Federal supervisor. The proposal also revises criteria for determining which banking organizations are subject to market risk-based capital requirements. It promotes consistency and comparability in market risk capital requirements and improves transparency through enhanced disclosures. The proposed rule applies market risk capital requirements to large banking organizations and retains a trading activity threshold, with an increased dollar threshold of $5 billion.
