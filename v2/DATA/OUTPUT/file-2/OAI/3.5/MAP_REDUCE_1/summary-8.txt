The proposed rule aims to ensure that banking organizations maintain capital that aligns with the level and nature of their risks. The agencies are seeking feedback on whether due diligence requirements should be directly integrated into the final rule. The proposal suggests replacing internal models with a new expanded risk-based approach for credit risk, which would result in more transparent capital requirements and reduce variability in risk-weighted assets. The proposal also introduces new risk-weight treatments for various categories of credit risk exposures, including defaulted exposures. For retail exposures, default would be determined based on criteria such as being 90 days past due or in nonaccrual status.
