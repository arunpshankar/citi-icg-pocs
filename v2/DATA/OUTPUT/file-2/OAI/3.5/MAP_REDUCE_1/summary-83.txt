The proposal aims to address concerns about regulatory arbitrage and deficiencies in the modeling of securitization positions. It requires banking organizations to calculate market risk capital requirements for securitization positions using the standardized approach or the fallback capital requirement. Distressed and defaulted market risk covered positions are only required to be included in the standardized default risk capital requirement, as calculating their sensitivity to changes in credit spreads may not be appropriate. The proposal caps the overall market risk capital requirement for defaulted, distressed, and securitization positions at the maximum loss of the position. For equity positions in an investment fund, banking organizations can use the look-through approach or calculate capital requirements based on a hypothetical portfolio. Alternatively, they can allocate equity positions to the other sector risk bucket. Equity positions in publicly traded real estate investment trusts are treated as a single exposure. The proposed alternatives aim to ensure sufficient capital against potential losses while minimizing compliance burden.
