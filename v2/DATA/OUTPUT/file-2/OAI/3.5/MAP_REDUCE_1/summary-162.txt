To calculate the standardized default risk capital requirement for securitization positions non-CTP, a banking organization must assign each position to a specific bucket based on asset class and region. Positions that cannot be assigned to a specific bucket are placed in the "other" buckets. The default risk capital requirement for each bucket is calculated using a formula that takes into account the risk weight and net default exposure. The standardized default risk capital requirement for securitization positions non-CTP is the sum of the bucket-level requirements. For correlation trading positions, the gross default exposure is determined based on market value, and the net default exposure is calculated using specific formulas. The default risk capital requirement for correlation trading positions is calculated for each bucket using a formula that considers the risk weight, net default exposure, and hedge benefit ratio.
