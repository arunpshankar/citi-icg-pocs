1. The agencies are seeking feedback on how to calibrate regulatory residential and commercial real estate exposures separately and what the appropriate calibration levels should be.
2. They are also seeking input on the treatment of second homes and vacation homes as regulatory residential real estate exposures and whether a different category would be more appropriate.
3. The agencies are asking for comments on the treatment of residential mortgage exposures dependent on cash flows from short-term rentals and the advantages and disadvantages of treating them similar to commercial real estate exposures.
4. The proposal requires banking organizations to use loan-to-value (LTV) ratios to assign risk weights to real estate exposures, with the LTV ratio calculated as the extension of credit divided by the value of the property.
5. The proposal also outlines the criteria for calculating the value of the property and the inclusion of readily marketable collateral and other acceptable collateral in the LTV ratio calculation.
