The proposed correlation parameters for risk factors closely follow those in the Basel III reforms and are calibrated to capture market correlations observed over a long time horizon. The proposal requires banking organizations to use prescribed correlation parameters when calculating capital requirements for delta, vega, and curvature. The proposal also includes specific criteria for determining correlation parameters for different risk factors, such as considering the name and tranche for certain positions. For securitization positions, a 100 percent intra-bucket correlation parameter is required for positions with significant overlap in notional terms. The proposal also includes a standardized default risk capital requirement for non-securitization debt or equity positions, securitization positions, and correlation trading positions. Banking organizations would need to calculate the gross default exposure, net default exposure, and hedge benefit ratio to determine the capital requirement for each default risk category.
