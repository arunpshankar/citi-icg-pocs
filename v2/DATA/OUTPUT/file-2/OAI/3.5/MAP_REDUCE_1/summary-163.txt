(i) The calculation of Expanded Total Risk-Weighted Assets for securitization exposure is determined by multiplying the corresponding risk weight by 8 percent.
(ii) The calculation of Standardized Total Risk-Weighted Assets for securitization exposure is determined by multiplying the corresponding risk weight by 8 percent.
(2) Non-tranched hedges of correlation trading positions have the same risk weights as non-securitization debt or equity positions, but they must be excluded from the calculation of the standardized default risk capital requirement.
(v) The standardized default risk capital requirement for correlation trading positions is calculated by aggregating the bucket-level capital requirements.
(a) The residual risk add-on is calculated for market risk covered positions that have exotic exposure, correlation trading positions with three or more underlying exposures, and other positions determined by the agency to have material risks.
(b) The residual risk add-on is calculated by multiplying the gross effective notional amounts of the identified market risk covered positions by the prescribed risk weights.
