The SA-CVA introduces an alternative approach for calculating credit spread risk in qualified indices, reducing complexity. It defines risk factors for interest rate, foreign exchange, reference credit spread, equity, and commodity risk classes. For interest rate risk, individual buckets are defined by currency, with delta factors based on absolute changes in risk-free yields and inflation rates. For foreign exchange risk, delta factors are based on relative changes in spot rates, and vega factors on relative changes in volatilities. Similar approaches are used for reference credit spread, equity, and commodity risk. The SA-CVA uses the same bucket structure, risk weights, and correlations as the sensitivities-based method for market risk, with reduced granularity for exposure-related risk factors.
