The proposed methodology for aggregating delta and CVA vega risk capital requirements involves aggregating net weighted sensitivities for each risk bucket and then across risk buckets within each risk class. The aggregation formulas include parameters such as regulatory correlation and hedging disallowance. The capital requirements are calculated separately for each risk class and then aggregated across risk classes without recognizing diversification benefits. The proposed transition provisions include a phased-in approach for expanded total risk-weighted assets and adjustments to AOCI regulatory capital over a three-year period. The goal of the transition provisions is to provide sufficient time for banking organizations to adjust to the proposal while minimizing the impact on their ability to lend. The impact and economic analysis of the proposal is also being considered.
