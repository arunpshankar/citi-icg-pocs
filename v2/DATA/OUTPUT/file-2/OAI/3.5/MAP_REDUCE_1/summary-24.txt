The proposal suggests implementing term-based haircuts for investment grade senior securitization exposures with a risk weight of less than 100 percent. Other securitization exposures would receive a 30 percent market price volatility haircut. The proposal also includes specific haircuts for equities and gold based on their liquidity. For collateral in the form of mutual fund shares, the proposal allows for a full look-through approach or an alternative method based on the weighted average of haircuts applicable to the instruments held by the mutual fund. The proposal also introduces minimum haircut floors for certain eligible margin loans and repo-style transactions with unregulated financial institutions to limit excessive leverage and reduce risk to the banking system.
