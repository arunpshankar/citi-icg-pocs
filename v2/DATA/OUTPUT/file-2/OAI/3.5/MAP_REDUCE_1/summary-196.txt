The revisions to ยง 217.10 include changes to the capital ratio requirements and buffers for Board-regulated institutions. The minimum capital requirements are outlined in paragraph (b) of the section. The supplementary leverage ratio for Board-regulated institutions subject to subpart E is the ratio of tier 1 capital to total leverage exposure, which is calculated based on on-balance sheet assets and off-balance sheet exposures. The total leverage exposure includes various components such as on-balance sheet assets, netting sets, and derivative contracts. The effective notional principal amount of credit derivatives provided by the institution can be reduced under certain conditions.
