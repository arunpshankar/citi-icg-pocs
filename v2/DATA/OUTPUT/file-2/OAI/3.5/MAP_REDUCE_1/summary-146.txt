The information provided discusses the calculation of capital requirements for banking organizations. The non-default risk capital requirement is calculated based on the internally modelled capital calculation (IMCC) and the stressed expected shortfall (SES). The standardized approach capital requirement (SA) is also included in the calculation. The fallback capital requirement is calculated as the sum of the standardized approach capital requirement and the fair values of other market risk covered positions. Market risk covered positions that cannot be calculated using the standardized approach or models-based measure are excluded from the calculation. Capital add-ons may be required for re-designations of exposures or positions.
