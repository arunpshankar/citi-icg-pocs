(1) A banking organization must calculate the gross default exposure for each non-securitization debt or equity position based on the loss given default rate, notional amount, and cumulative profit and loss already realized on the position.
(2) The net default exposure to an obligor is calculated by summing the maturity-weighted default exposures to the issuer and offsetting long and short gross default exposures to the same obligor, provided the short exposures have the same or lower seniority.
(3) The standardized default risk capital requirement for non-securitization debt or equity positions is calculated by assigning each position to one of four buckets and applying risk weights based on credit quality categories.
(4) For securitization positions, the gross default exposure is determined based on the position's market value, and offsetting is allowed for positions with the same underlying asset pools and belonging to the same tranche.
(5) Securitization positions that can be replicated through decomposition may offset, and non-securitization positions recognized as offsetting must be excluded from the calculation of the standardized default risk capital requirement for non-securitization positions.
