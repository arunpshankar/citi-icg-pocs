Table 1 provides the supervisory risk weights for different sectors of counterparties. The risk weights vary based on the credit quality of the counterparty and the sector it belongs to. The agencies are seeking comments on the appropriateness of these risk weights for financials and government-backed entities. They are also seeking feedback on the calibration factor used in the capital requirement formula for CVA risk. The calculation of Khedged represents the risk-based capital requirements for CVA risk after recognizing the risk mitigation benefits of eligible counterparty credit spread hedges. The proposal includes formulas for calculating the capital reduction for single-name hedges and index hedges of credit spread risk. The agencies are seeking comments on the use of the counterparty credit risk framework to calculate the exposure amount for standalone CVA counterparty-level capital requirement.
