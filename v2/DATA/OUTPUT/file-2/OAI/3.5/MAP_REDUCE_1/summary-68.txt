The proposal outlines the calculation steps for determining the standardized default risk capital requirement for non-securitization debt or equity positions. This includes multiplying the notional amount of the instrument by the prescribed loss given default rate to determine the potential loss of principal at default. The proposal also specifies the loss given default rates for different types of instruments, such as equity, senior debt, GSE debt, and covered bonds. The net default exposure for these positions can be partially offset if certain criteria are met, such as referencing the same obligor and having the same or lower seniority for short positions. The maturity of the positions is also taken into account when determining the offsetting treatment.
