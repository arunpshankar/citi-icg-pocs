The proposal requires banking organizations to meet risk management requirements for identifying and managing CVA risk positions and hedges. They must have a clearly defined hedging policy for CVA risk and document their risk management processes. Banking organizations using the standardized measure for CVA risk must comply with additional operational requirements, including documentation, initial approval, and ongoing performance of regulatory CVA models. The proposal aligns regulatory CVA with accounting CVA and requires the use of CVA models for calculating regulatory CVA. Banking organizations must have a designated CVA desk or function for active management of CVA risk. The proposal also includes ongoing eligibility requirements and control and oversight measures for CVA risk management.
