The proposal aims to address challenges posed by the current measurement approach (AMA) for operational risk in banking organizations. The AMA results in uncertainty and lack of transparency, making it difficult to assess operational risk across organizations. The proposal suggests removing the AMA and introducing a standardized approach based on a banking organization's business indicator and internal loss multiplier. The business indicator would capture a banking organization's business volume and be calculated using inputs from financial statements. The internal loss multiplier would increase the operational risk capital requirement based on historical operational losses. The proposal also outlines the components of the business indicator, including interest, lease, and dividend income.
