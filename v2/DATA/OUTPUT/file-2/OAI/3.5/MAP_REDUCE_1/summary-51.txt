The proposal introduces the concept of a trading desk and expands the requirements for identifying market risk covered positions. Banking organizations would need to update their policies and procedures for identifying these positions annually and establish a framework for re-designating positions. The proposal also requires banking organizations to have clearly defined trading and hedging strategies for their market risk covered positions. The definition of a trading desk includes requirements for a well-defined business strategy and coordinated trading activity. The proposal also introduces the concept of a notional trading desk for positions that may not originate from existing trading desks.
