The proposal aims to expand the types of positions that would be considered market risk covered positions, including certain equity positions in investment funds, net short risk positions, certain publicly traded equity positions, embedded derivatives on instruments issued by banking organizations, and positions associated with internal risk transfer. The proposal would require banking organizations to calculate net short risk positions by comparing the notional amounts of their long and short credit and equity positions. The proposed market risk capital requirements would only apply to net short risk positions where the notional amount of the short position exceeds the notional amount of the long position by $20 million or more. The proposal would also include all publicly traded equity positions as market risk covered positions, regardless of whether they are trading assets or liabilities. Additionally, the proposal would include embedded derivatives in the definition of market risk covered positions, regardless of how they are treated under GAAP.
