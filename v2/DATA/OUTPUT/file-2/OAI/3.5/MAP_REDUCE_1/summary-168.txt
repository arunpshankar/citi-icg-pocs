The information provided outlines the requirements for calculating the time series of changes in risk factors over a base liquidity horizon. It specifies that observations of price differentials from overlapping 10-day periods should be used, without scaling up from a shorter horizon. A banking organization must identify a 12-month period of stress over the observation horizon, using either the full set of risk factors or a reduced set. The organization must update this period at least quarterly or when there are material changes in the risk factors. The liquidity horizon-adjusted ES-based measure can be calibrated using either a direct approach or an indirect approach. The input data for internal models used to calculate the ES-based measure must be updated quarterly and whenever there are material changes in market prices. The models must address non-linearities, correlation, and relevant basis risks. Empirical correlations within risk factor classes can be recognized, but correlations across classes are constrained. The models must also capture the risks associated with options and model the volatility surface across strike price and maturity. Liquidity horizons must be assigned to each risk factor, with specific requirements for different categories.
