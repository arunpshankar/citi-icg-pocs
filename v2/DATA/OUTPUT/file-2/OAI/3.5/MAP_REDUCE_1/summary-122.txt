VNS is the fair value of derivative contracts within a netting set, excluding any valuation adjustments. CMA is the sum of the net independent collateral amount and the variation margin amount for derivative contracts subject to a single variation margin agreement. Potential future exposure for netting sets subject to a single variation margin agreement is calculated by assigning a single potential future exposure to each netting set. Replacement cost for netting sets subject to multiple variation margin agreements is calculated by summing the variation margin thresholds and minimum transfer amounts of all agreements within the netting set. Risk-weighted assets for cleared transactions are calculated based on the trade exposure amount multiplied by the appropriate risk weight.
