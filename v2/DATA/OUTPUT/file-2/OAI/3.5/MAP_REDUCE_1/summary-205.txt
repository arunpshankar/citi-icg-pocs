The information provided includes revisions to the definitions of "regulatory capital ratio" in various sections of the regulations. The revisions state that the regulatory capital ratio is a capital ratio for which the Board has established minimum requirements for the company, including any regulatory capital ratios calculated under 12 CFR part 217 and deductions required under 12 CFR 248.12. The revisions also specify that savings and loan holding companies must calculate their regulatory capital ratios using either 12 CFR part 217, subpart D, or 12 CFR part 217, subpart E, whichever results in a higher amount of total risk-weighted assets. Additionally, the revisions outline the calculation for stress capital buffer requirement for covered savings and loan holding companies.
