The information provided discusses the deductions that national banks and Federal savings associations must make from their regulatory capital. These deductions include adjustments to common equity tier 1 capital elements, significant investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions, and certain assets that are not sufficient to effect deductions. The deductions are net of associated deferred tax liabilities (DTLs). There are specific thresholds and requirements for these deductions based on the type of institution and its capital elements. Additionally, any items that are deducted from regulatory capital must be excluded from risk-weighted assets.
