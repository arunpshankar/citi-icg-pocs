The information provided includes formulas for calculating the hedging set amount for different types of derivative contracts. The formulas involve variables such as reference entities, commodity types, supervisory correlation factors, and adjusted derivative contract amounts. The adjusted derivative contract amount is determined by multiplying the adjusted notional amount of the derivative contract by various factors, including supervisory delta adjustment, maturity factor, and supervisory factor. The adjusted notional amount is calculated differently depending on the type of derivative contract, such as interest rate, credit, exchange rate, equity, or commodity. The supervisory delta adjustment varies based on whether the derivative contract is an option contract or not.
