The proposal requires banking organizations to calculate a residual risk add-on for certain market risk covered positions. This includes positions with exotic exposures and positions with other residual risks. The add-on capital requirement is 1 percent of the gross effective notional amount for positions with exotic exposures and 0.1 percent for positions with other residual risks. Certain positions, such as those listed on an exchange or eligible to be cleared by a CCP, can be excluded from the calculation. Banking organizations can also exclude positions that have been matched with a back-to-back transaction or that exhibit insignificant residual risks. The proposal seeks comments on alternative methods to identify exotic exposures and other residual risks, as well as suggestions for additional exclusions and quantitative measures to identify residual risks.
