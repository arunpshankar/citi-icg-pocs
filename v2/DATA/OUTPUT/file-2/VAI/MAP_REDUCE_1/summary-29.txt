 1. The proposal introduces a risk-weight floor of 100% for resecuritization exposures and NPL securitization exposures. 


2.  Exceptions to the SEC-SA risk-based capital treatment for securitization exposures are proposed, including for nth-to-default credit derivatives and derivative contracts that do not provide credit enhancements.


3.  A new treatment for certain interest rate or foreign exchange derivative contracts that qualify as securitization exposures is proposed.


4.  The proposal introduces new provisions for overlapping exposures, allowing a banking organization to treat two non-overlapping securitization exposures as overlapping to the degree that the banking organization assumes that obligations with respect to one of the exposures covers obligations with respect to the other exposure.


5.  A look-through approach for senior securitization exposures is proposed, allowing a banking organization to cap the risk weight applied to a senior securitization exposure that is not a resecuritization exposure at the weighted-average risk weight of the underlying exposures.
