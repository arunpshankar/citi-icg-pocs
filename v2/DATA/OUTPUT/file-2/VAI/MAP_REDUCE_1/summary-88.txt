 The proposal requires banking organizations to satisfy certain general risk management requirements related to the identification and management of CVA risk covered positions and eligible CVA hedges. 
Documentation requirements are designed to facilitate regulatory review and a banking organization's internal risk management and oversight processes. 
Banking organizations that use the standardized measure for CVA risk would be required to comply with additional operational requirements on documentation, initial approval, and ongoing performance of regulatory CVA models. 
The proposal would require a banking organization to maintain an independent risk control unit that is responsible for the effective initial and ongoing validation of the models used for calculating regulatory CVA. 
Senior management of the banking organization would be required to have oversight of the CVA risk control process.
