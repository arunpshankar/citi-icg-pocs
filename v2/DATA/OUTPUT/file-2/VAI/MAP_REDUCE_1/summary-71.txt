 1. The proposal requires banking organizations to calculate a residual risk add-on for market risk covered positions with exotic exposures and certain other residual risks. 


2. The residual risk add-on capital requirement would equal the sum of such capital requirements across subject market risk covered positions. 


3. Positions subject to the residual risk add-on include those with exotic exposures, certain correlation trading positions, options or positions with embedded optionality, and other positions as determined by the primary Federal supervisor. 


4. Excluded positions include those that are listed on an exchange, eligible to be cleared by a CCP or QCCP, certain options, and certain offsetting positions. 


5. The agencies seek comment on all aspects of the proposed residual risk add-on, including alternative methods to identify exotic exposures and other residual risks, additional instruments and offsetting positions that should be excluded, and quantitative measures to identify or distinguish residual risks.
