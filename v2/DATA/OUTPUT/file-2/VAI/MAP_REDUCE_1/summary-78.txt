2. The measure is calculated at the entity-wide level for each risk class and across risk classes for all model-eligible trading desks.
3. The proposal also includes a stress period that is reviewed and updated quarterly or when there are material changes in risk factors.
4. The agencies request comment on the appropriateness of assigning a liquidity horizon for multi-underlying instruments and requiring banking organizations to use the next longer liquidity horizon for instruments with a maturity shorter than the respective liquidity horizon assigned to the risk factor.
5. The agencies also request comment on the appropriateness of the proposed stress period and the frequency of review and update.
