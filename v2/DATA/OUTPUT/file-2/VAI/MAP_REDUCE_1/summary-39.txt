The business indicator component would increase at a rate of 12% per unit of business indicator for levels of business indicator up to $1 billion, 15% per unit of business indicator for levels of business indicator above $1 billion and up to $30 billion, and 18% per unit of business indicator for levels of business indicator above $30 billion. 

3. The internal loss multiplier would increase operational risk capital requirements based on a banking organization's historical operational loss experience. 

4. The internal loss multiplier would be calculated as follows: Internal Loss Multiplier = {1, in (exp(1 - (15 x Average Annual Total Net Operational Losses / Business Indicator Component)^0.8))}. 

5. The proposal would require the internal loss multiplier to be no less than one.
