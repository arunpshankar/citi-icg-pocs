 1. The exposure amount of a securitization exposure is generally the carrying value of the exposure for on-balance sheet exposures and the notional amount of the exposure for off-balance sheet exposures. 
2. A banking organization may apply the SEC-SA to a securitization exposure if it has accurate information on certain parameters and the exposure meets certain requirements. 
3. The risk-weighted asset amount of a securitization exposure to which the SEC-SA is applied is the product of the exposure amount and a risk weight. 
4. The risk weight for a securitization exposure under the SEC-SA is determined based on the credit quality of the underlying exposures, the seniority of the exposure, and the interest rate or exchange rate risk of the exposure. 
5. There are specific risk-weighting requirements for resecuritization exposures, exposures to ABCP programs, and exposures to securitizations of non-financial assets.
