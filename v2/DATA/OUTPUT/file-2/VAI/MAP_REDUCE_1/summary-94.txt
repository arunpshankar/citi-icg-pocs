3. The proposal specifies the sensitivity calculations to measure the impact of risk factors on the aggregate regulatory CVA and eligible CVA hedges. 
4. For vega risk factors, a banking organization should apply the shift to the relevant volatility used for generating risk factor simulation paths and, if applicable, the volatility used to price options. 
5. The proposal allows the introduction of additional risk factors that directly correspond to qualified credit and equity indices, subject to certain conditions.
