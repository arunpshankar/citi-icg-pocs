 1. The proposal introduces enhanced operational requirements for banking organizations that use the internal models approach under the models-based measure for market risk. 


2. These requirements include validation, documentation, model eligibility, ongoing eligibility, and changes to trading desk structure or internal models. 


3. The proposal establishes a framework for initial approval of internal models, including criteria for trading desks to satisfy in order to be considered model-eligible. 


4. Ongoing eligibility requirements include quarterly backtesting and PLA testing, and prior written approval from the primary Federal supervisor for any changes that could materially impact risk-weighted asset amounts or internal modelled capital calculations. 


5. The proposal aims to ensure that internal models accurately capture market risk and are appropriate for the trading desks they are applied to.
