 1. The calculation of curvature risk-weighted sensitivity involves applying upward and downward shocks to the yield curve and measuring the change in value.


2. The proposal requires a banking organization to apply the highest risk weight across risk buckets to each tenor point along the curve for conservatism.


3. For the foreign exchange and equity risk classes, the shocks represent a relative shift of the spot prices equal to the delta risk weight.


4. The proposal allows a banking organization to divide the net curvature risk positions by a scalar of 1.5 for positions that do not reference the reporting or base currency.


5. The agencies seek comment on the appropriateness of calculating the curvature risk-weighted sensitivity for the commodity risk class using a parallel shift of all tenors.
