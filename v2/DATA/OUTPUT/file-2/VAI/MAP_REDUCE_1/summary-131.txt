 1. The risk weight of a securitization exposure is calculated using the SEC-SA formula.
2. RW FLOOR is 100% for resecuritization and NPL securitization exposures and 15% for all other securitization exposures.
3. KA is calculated based on the outstanding balance of all underlying assets in the securitization and the outstanding balance of all tranches that rank senior or pari passu to the tranche that contains the securitization exposure.
4. A [BANKING ORGANIZATION] must include the funded portion of any reserve account funded by the accumulated cash flows from the underlying exposures that is subordinated to the [BANKING ORGANIZATION]'s securitization exposure in the calculation of A and D.
