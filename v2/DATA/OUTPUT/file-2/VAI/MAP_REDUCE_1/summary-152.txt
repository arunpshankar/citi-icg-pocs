 The capital requirements for market risk for banking organizations are based on a standardized approach that uses a risk-weighting framework. The risk weights are based on the sensitivities of the market risk covered positions to changes in the risk factors. The sensitivities are calculated by changing the risk factor by a small amount and dividing the resulting change in the value of the market risk covered position by the change in the risk factor. The sensitivities are then multiplied by the volatility of the risk factor to calculate the vega sensitivity.
