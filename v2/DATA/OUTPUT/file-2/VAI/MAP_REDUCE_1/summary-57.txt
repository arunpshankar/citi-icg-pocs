 1. The agencies propose a standardized approach to calculating market risk capital requirements for banking organizations with less sophisticated risk management capabilities. 


2. The standardized approach would replace the current value-at-risk (VaR)-based measure with an expected shortfall measure to capture tail risk. 


3. The proposal also would limit the regulatory capital benefit of hedging and portfolio diversification across different asset classes, which generally dissipates in stress periods. 


4. For banking organizations with more sophisticated risk management capabilities, the agencies propose a models-based measure for market risk capital requirements that would allow them to use their own internal models to calculate capital requirements, subject to certain conditions. 


5. The proposal also includes a fallback capital requirement for situations when a banking organization is unable to calculate market risk capital requirements under either the standardized approach or the internal models approach.
