 1. The proposal introduces a risk-based capital framework for regulatory residential and commercial real estate exposures. 


2. The framework assigns risk weights to these exposures based on loan-to-value ratios and dependency on cash flows generated by the real estate. 


3. The proposal also includes a definition of defaulted real estate exposure and requires banking organizations to apply an elevated risk weight to such exposures. 


4. The agencies seek comment on the impact of the proposed treatment on home affordability and homeownership opportunities, particularly for low- and moderate-income borrowers. 


5. The agencies also seek comment on assigning risk weights to residential mortgage exposures consistent with the current U.S. standardized risk-based capital framework.
