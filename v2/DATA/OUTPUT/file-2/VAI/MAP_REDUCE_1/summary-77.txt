 1. The proposal introduces a liquidity horizon-adjusted expected shortfall-based measure for the full set of risk factors in stress.
2. The banking organization would multiply the liquidity horizon-adjusted expected shortfall-based measure for the stress period based on the reduced set of risk factors (ESR,S) by a ratio.
3. The proposal would floor this ratio at one to prevent a reduction in capital requirements due to using the reduced set of risk factors.
4. The proposal would require the entity-wide liquidity horizon-adjusted expected shortfall-based measure for the current period based on the reduced set of risk factors (ESR,C) to explain at least 75 percent of the variability of the losses estimated by the liquidity horizon-adjusted expected shortfall-based measure in the current period for the full set of risk factors (ESF,c) over the preceding 60 business days.
5. The proposal would also require the reduced set of modellable risk factors used to calculate the liquidity horizon-adjusted expected shortfall-based measure for the stress period to have a sufficiently long history of observations that satisfies the data quality requirements for modellable risk factors.
