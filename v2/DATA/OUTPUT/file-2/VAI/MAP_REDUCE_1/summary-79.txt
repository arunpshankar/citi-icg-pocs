 1. The agencies propose a capital framework for banking organizations' market risk. 


2. The framework includes an internal models capital charge (IMCC) for modellable risk factors and a stressed expected shortfall (SES) capital charge for non-modellable risk factors. 


3. The IMCC is based on liquidity horizon-adjusted expected shortfall measures, while the SES is based on a stress scenario that is calibrated to be at least as prudent as the expected shortfall-based measure for modellable risk factors. 


4. The proposal also includes a backtesting requirement for VaR-based measures against both actual profit and loss as well as against hypothetical profit and loss. 


5. The agencies seek comment on the appropriateness of the proposed treatment of non-modellable risk factors and the backtesting requirement.
